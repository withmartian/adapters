        on the context:\n\n1. **Song by Wings**: \"Hi, Hi, Hi\" is a song written
        by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by the band Wings. It was released
        as a double A-side single with \"C Moon\" in 1972. The song was banned by
        the BBC in the UK for its sexually suggestive lyrical content and became a
        staple of Wings'' live shows in the 1970s[2][3].\n\n2. **Anime and Merchandise**:
        \"Hi\" can also refer to a brand or term used in the context of anime and
        merchandise, such as \"Hihi\" which might be associated with a store like
        \"Hellohihi.com\" that sells anime-related items like figures, plushies, and
        manga[1].\n\nIf you have any specific question about one of these contexts,
        please let me know"}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
