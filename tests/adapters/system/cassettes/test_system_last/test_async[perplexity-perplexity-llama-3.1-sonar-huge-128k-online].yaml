        a song by Wings. Here are some key points about the song:\n\n- **Song Details**:
        \"Hi, Hi, Hi\" is a song written by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed
        by Wings. It was released as a double A-side single with \"C Moon\" in 1972[2].\n-
        **Release and Chart Performance**: The single was issued on 1 December 1972
        in the UK and three days later in the US. It peaked at number one in Spain,
        number five in the United Kingdom, and number 10 in the United States in January
        1973[2].\n- **Lyrics and Controversy**: The song was banned by the BBC in
        the UK due to its sexually suggestive lyrical content. Paul McCartney has
        clarified that some of the lyrics were misinterpreted, such as \"get you ready
        for my polygon\" being mistaken for \"get you ready for my body gun\"[2][3].\n-
        **Inclusion in Compilations**: The song has been included on several Paul
        McCartney compilation albums, including \"Wingspan: Hits and History\" (2001),
        \"Pure McCartney\" (2016), and as a bonus track on the reissues of \"Red Rose
        Speedway\" (1993 and 2018)[2].\n- **Live Performances**: \"Hi, Hi, Hi\" became
        a staple of Wings'' live shows in the 1970s, with Paul McCartney often introducing
        it as a banned song to the audience''s delight[2].\n\nFor more detailed information,
        including the full lyrics and translations, you can refer to sources like
        Wikipedia[2], Letras.mus.br[3][5], and Vagalume[4]."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
