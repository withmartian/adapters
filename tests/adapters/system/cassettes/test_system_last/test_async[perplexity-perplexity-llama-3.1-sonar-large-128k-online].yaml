        "content": "The phrase \"Hi, Hi, Hi\" is most notably associated with a song
        by the band Wings, which was formed by Paul McCartney after his departure
        from The Beatles.\n\n## Song Details\n- \"Hi, Hi, Hi\" was written by Paul
        and Linda McCartney and released as a double A-side single with \"C Moon\"
        in December 1972[2].\n- The song is characterized by its glam rock genre and
        features suggestive lyrics, which led to it being banned by the BBC due to
        perceived sexual and drug references[2].\n- Despite the ban, the song was
        a commercial success, reaching number one in Spain, number five in the UK,
        and number 10 in the US[2].\n\n## Lyrics and Interpretation\n- The lyrics
        describe a lively and energetic encounter, with lines like \"We''re gonna
        get hi, hi, hi\" and references to a \"multicoloured band\" and a \"polygon,\"
        which McCartney clarified was an abstract image and not a drug reference[3][5].\n\n##
        Release and Legacy\n- The song was included in several of Paul McCartney''s
        compilation albums, including *Wingspan: Hits and History*, *Pure McCartney*,
        and reissues of *Red Rose Speedway*[2].\n- It remained a staple in Wings''
        live performances during the 1970s[2]."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content":
