        seems like you''re looking for information on how to handle a situation where
        you''re feeling overwhelmed by the expectations of others, particularly in
        the context of your work or personal life. Here are some steps you can take
        to manage these expectations and reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed:\n\n1.
        **Identify the Expectations**: Make a list of the expectations that are making
        you feel overwhelmed. Understand who is setting these expectations (yourself,
        your boss, your family, etc.) and why they are important to them.\n\n2. **Assess
        the Importance**: Determine which expectations are truly important and which
        are not essential. Prioritize based on what aligns with your values and goals.\n\n3.
        **Communicate**: If the expectations are coming from others, have an open
        and honest conversation about them. Express your concerns and ask for clarification
        or negotiation. If the expectations are self-imposed, acknowledge them to
        yourself and consider why you feel the need to meet them.\n\n4. **Set Boundaries**:
        Learn to say no or set limits on your time and energy. It''s okay to decline
        requests or opportunities that don''t serve your well-being or align with
        your priorities.\n","tool_calls":null},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null,"asr_results":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":11,"total_tokens":267,"completion_tokens":256}}'
