        <<SYS>>\nI am looking for some help. I have been working on a project, and
        I have a specific problem I''m trying to solve. I have a dataset that contains
        information about people''s income, and I have been asked to find the median
        income of this dataset. The catch is that the income data is in the form of
        ranges rather than specific values. For example, one entry might be \"$40,000
        - $50,000\", and another might be \"$30,000 - $60,000\". I need to find a
        way to calculate the median income from these ranges.\n\nI''m looking for
        advice on the best approach to solve this problem. Should I convert each range
        into a single value (e.g., the midpoint of the range) and then calculate the
        median? Or is there a more accurate method that takes into account the range
        itself? Any guidance or resources you can provide would be greatly appreciated.
        I''m open to any programming language or statistical method that might be
        helpful. [/INST] <<SYS>>\nThe problem you''re facing is quite interesting
        and not uncommon when dealing with income data. The key challenge here is
        that we''re not dealing with precise values, but rather ranges. This means
        we can''t directly apply the traditional method of finding the median","tool_calls":null},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":19,"total_tokens":275,"completion_tokens":256}}'
