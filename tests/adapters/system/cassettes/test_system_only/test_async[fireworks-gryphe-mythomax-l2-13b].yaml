        fix this issue, you can try these steps:\n\n1. Check if your computer meets
        the minimum system requirements for the game. The specifications might be
        too low for the game to run smoothly.\n\n2. Update your graphics card drivers
        to the latest version. Old or outdated drivers can cause compatibility issues
        and affect performance.\n\n3. Close other applications and background processes
        that might be using your GPU. This includes any other games or graphics-intensive
        programs.\n\n4. Adjust the in-game settings, especially the graphics settings,
        to optimize performance. Lowering graphics settings can improve FPS.\n\n5.
        Clean your computer''s temp files and hard drive to clear up storage space.
        This can help reduce load times and improve performance.\n\n6. Overclock your
        CPU or GPU if you''re comfortable with it. This can provide a boost in performance
        but can also cause instability or overheating.\n\n7. Consider upgrading your
        hardware if your current setup is not capable of running the game at an acceptable
        speed."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":8,"total_tokens":231,"completion_tokens":223}}'
