        not sure if I understand your question correctly. If you are asking about
        the effects of meditation on mental health, there is a lot of research that
        suggests that regular meditation can help improve various aspects of mental
        health. These include reducing stress and anxiety, improving focus and concentration,
        enhancing emotional regulation, and even increasing happiness and life satisfaction.
        It''s also often recommended as a complementary therapy for conditions like
        depression, PTSD, and bipolar disorder. \n\nHowever, meditation is not a substitute
        for professional medical help if you are struggling with serious mental health
        issues. Always consult with a healthcare professional if you are experiencing
        significant emotional distress.","tool_calls":null},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop","audio":null,"asr_results":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":10,"total_tokens":144,"completion_tokens":134}}'
