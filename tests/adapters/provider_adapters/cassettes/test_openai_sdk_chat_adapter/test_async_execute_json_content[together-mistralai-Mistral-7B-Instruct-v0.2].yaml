        It seems you have provided an object in JavaScript format, but it is not displayed
        properly in this text format. To help you, I would need more context about
        what information is contained in this object and what you would like to do
        with it.\n\nIf you want to access the properties or values of the object,
        you can use the dot notation or the bracket notation. For example, if the
        object''s name is `myObj` and it has a property named `name`:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(myObj.name);
        // using dot notation\nconsole.log(myObj[''name'']); // using bracket notation\n```\n\nIf
        you want to convert the object to a string representation, you can use the
        `JSON.stringify()` method:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(myObj));\n```\n\nIf
        you want to ask a specific question about this object or perform a certain
        operation, please provide more details or context."}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":13,"completion_tokens":210,"total_tokens":223}}'
