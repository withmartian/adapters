        It looks like you are trying to access an object property or method, but you
        are getting the string \"[object Object]\" instead. This is likely because
        you are trying to access the property or method on the object itself, rather
        than on a property or method of the object.\n\nFor example, if you have an
        object called `myObject` and you want to access a property called `myProperty`,
        you would use the following code:\n```\nconsole.log(myObject.myProperty);\n```\nIf
        you are getting the string \"[object Object]\" instead of the expected value,
        it is likely because you are trying to access the property or method on the
        object itself, rather than on a property or method of the object.\n\nFor example,
        if you have an object called `myObject` and you want to access a method called
        `myMethod`, you would use the following code:\n```\nmyObject.myMethod();\n```\nIf
        you are still having trouble, please provide more information about your code
        and what you are trying to accomplish."}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":13,"completion_tokens":219,"total_tokens":232}}'
