        seems like you''re trying to print an object, but the object is not a string.
        Instead, it''s an object with properties and methods.\n\nTo print an object,
        you can use the `console.log()` method, like this:\n```\nconsole.log(myObject);\n```\nThis
        will print the object to the console, along with its properties and methods.\n\nAlternatively,
        you can use the `JSON.stringify()` method to convert the object to a JSON
        string, like this:\n```\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(myObject));\n```\nThis
        will print the object as a JSON string, which can be useful for debugging
        purposes.\n\nIf you''re trying to print a specific property of the object,
        you can use the dot notation, like this:\n```\nconsole.log(myObject.propertyName);\n```\nThis
        will print the value of the `propertyName` property of the `myObject` object.\n\nI
        hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":13,"completion_tokens":226,"total_tokens":239}}'
