        than \"hello\" and is often used when passing someone on the street or in
        a small town. In the context of the song \"Hi\" by Lauren Sanderson, the term
        is used as a greeting in the lyrics, which include lines like \"Hi, 6am sunlight\"
        and \"Hi, 6am sunrise\". The song also contains references to cell phones,
        government lies, and personal relationships, among other topics."}, "delta":
