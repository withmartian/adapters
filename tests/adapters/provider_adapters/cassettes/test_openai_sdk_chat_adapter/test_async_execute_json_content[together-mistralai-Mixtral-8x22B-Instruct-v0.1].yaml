        is a common output in JavaScript when trying to print an object directly to
        the console or convert it to a string. It indicates that the object being
        printed is not a primitive data type (like a number or string), but rather
        a complex data type that contains properties and methods.\n\nTo view the contents
        of an object, you can use the console.log() method and pass the object as
        an argument. This will print the object''s properties and their values to
        the console. Alternatively, you can use the JSON.stringify() method to convert
        the object to a string representation that can be printed or displayed.\n\nHere''s
        an example:\n```javascript\nlet obj = { name: \"John\", age: 30 };\nconsole.log(obj);
        // Output: { name: ''John'', age: 30 }\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(obj));
        // Output: {\"name\":\"John\",\"age\":30}\n```\nIn the first console.log()
        statement, the object is printed directly to the console, showing its properties
        and values. In the second statement, the object is converted to a string using
        JSON.stringify() and then printed to the console. The output is a string representation
        of the object that can be easily read and understood."}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":18,"completion_tokens":268,"total_tokens":286}}'
