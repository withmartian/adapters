        term \"hi\" is primarily used as an informal greeting, similar to \"hello\"
        but more casual. Here are some key points about its usage and origins:\n\n1.
        **Usage**:\n   - **Greeting**: \"Hi\" is used as a friendly, informal greeting,
        often to people you know.\n   - **Casual**: It is more casual than \"hello\"
        and is appropriate in all but the most formal circumstances.\n\n2. **Etymology**:\n   -
        **Origin**: The word \"hi\" originated in American English, first recorded
        in the speech of a Kansas Indian in 1862. It is believed to be a variant of
        Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which was used to attract attention.\n\n3.
        **Variations**:\n   - **Interjection**: \"Hi\" is used as an interjection
        to greet someone or to call attention.\n   - **Adjective**: In some contexts,
        \"hi\" can be an informal spelling of \"high,\" often used in hyphenated terms
        like \"hi-fi\" or \"hi-definition\".\n\n4. **Examples**:\n   - **Greetings**:
        \"Hi, there!\", \"Hi, how are you doing?\", \"Hi, Lewis. How are you?\".\n   -
        **Calling Attention**: \"Hi!\" can be used to call someone''s attention, similar
        to \"Hey!\" or \"Hello!\".\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is a versatile, informal
        greeting that is widely used in casual contexts. Its origins trace back to
        American English, specifically from the speech of a Kansas Indian in the 19th
        century."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
