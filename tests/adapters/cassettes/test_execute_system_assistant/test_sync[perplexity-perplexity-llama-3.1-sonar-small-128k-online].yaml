        into a versatile greeting that can be used in various contexts, including
        calling attention or simply saying hello.\n\n### Usage\n- **Greeting**: \"Hi\"
        is often used as an exclamation of greeting, similar to \"hello!\".\n- **Informal**:
        It is an informal word that can be used in casual settings, such as among
        friends or in everyday conversations.\n- **Variations**: There are various
        forms and uses of \"hi,\" including its use in different cultures and dialects,
        such as in Hong Kong Cantonese where it can mean \"hello\" or be used as an
        interjection to call attention.\n\n### Examples\n- \"Hi, there!\" - A friendly
        greeting.\n- \"Hi, how are you?\" - A more detailed inquiry about someone''s
        well-being.\n- \"Hi!\" - A simple way to acknowledge someone''s presence.\n\nIn
        summary, \"hi\" is a versatile and widely used greeting that is appropriate
