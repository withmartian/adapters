        banned by the BBC due to its sexually suggestive lyrical content and the assumption

        Paul McCartney clarified that the lyrics were misunderstood, stating that
        the correct phrase is \"get you ready for my polygon,\" an abstract image.\n\n4.
        **Inclusion in Compilations**: The song was included on various Paul McCartney
        compilation albums such as \"Wingspan: Hits and History\" (2001), \"Pure McCartney\"
