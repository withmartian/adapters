        with people you know.\n- **Origin**: The word \"hi\" is believed to have originated
        from Middle English \"hy\" or \"hey,\" which was used to attract attention.\n-
        **Pronunciation**: The pronunciation of \"hi\" is /ha\u026a/ in American English
        and /ha\u026a/ in British English.\n- **Synonyms**: Other informal greetings
        include \"hey,\" \"hello,\" \"hiya,\" and \"howdy\".\n- **Cultural Context**:
