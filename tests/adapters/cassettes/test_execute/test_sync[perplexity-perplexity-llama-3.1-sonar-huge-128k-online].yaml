        term \"hi\" is primarily used as an informal greeting, similar to \"hello\"
        but more casual. Here are some key points about its usage and origins:\n\n1.
        **Greeting**: \"Hi\" is used to greet people, especially those you know. It''s
        a friendly and casual way to acknowledge someone''s presence.\n\n2. **Informal**:
        It''s more informal than \"hello\" and is commonly used in everyday interactions,
        except in very formal situations.\n\n3. **Origins**: The word \"hi\" originated
        in the late Middle English period, possibly as a variant of \"hey\" or \"hy,\"
        and was first recorded in the speech of a Kansas Indian in 1862.\n\n4. **Usage
        Examples**: It can be used in various contexts, such as saying \"hi\" to someone
        you meet on the street, in a workplace, or in a social setting.\n\n5. **Variations**:
        There are other forms of greetings similar to \"hi,\" including \"hey,\" \"hello,\"
        \"hiya,\" and \"howdy,\" but \"hi\" remains one of the most common and versatile.\n\nIn
        the context of the YouTube video provided in the first search result, \"hi\"
        is used as a greeting to address the audience before discussing personal issues
        and responding to rumors. However, the video''s content is unrelated to the
        definition and usage of the word \"hi\" itself."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
