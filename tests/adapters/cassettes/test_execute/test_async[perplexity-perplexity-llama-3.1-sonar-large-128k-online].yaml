        term \"hi\" is a common, informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s
        presence. Here are some key points about its usage and origins:\n\n- **Usage**:
        \"Hi\" is an informal, casual greeting, often used among friends or in everyday
        interactions. It is more casual than \"hello\" and is suitable for most non-formal
        situations.\n- **Origins**: The word \"hi\" is believed to have originated
        from Middle English words such as \"hey\" and \"hy,\" with the first recorded
        reference in American English attributed to the speech of a Kansas Indian
        in 1862.\n- **Pronunciation**: It is pronounced as /ha\u026a/ in both American
        and British English.\n- **Examples**: It can be used in various contexts,
        such as \"Hi, how are you?\" or simply \"Hi!\" to greet someone.\n\nOverall,
        \"hi\" is a versatile and widely used greeting that is appropriate in many
        social settings."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
