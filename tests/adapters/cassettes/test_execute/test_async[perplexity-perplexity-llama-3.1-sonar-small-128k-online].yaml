        is a common, informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence. It
        is often more casual than \"hello\" and is frequently used in everyday interactions,
        especially among people who know each other.\n\n### Etymology\nThe word \"hi\"
        has its origins in late Middle English, possibly derived from the variant
        \"hy\" or \"hey,\" which were used to attract attention.\n\n### Usage\n- **Greeting**:
        \"Hi\" is commonly used as an exclamation of greeting, similar to \"hello,\"
        but more casual.\n- **Attention**: It can also be used to attract attention,
        similar to \"hey\".\n- **Informal Spelling**: In some contexts, \"hi\" is
        an informal spelling of \"high,\" especially in terms like \"hi-fidelity\".\n\n###
        Examples\n- \"Hi, there!\" - A friendly greeting.\n- \"Hi, how are you?\"
        - A casual inquiry about someone''s well-being.\n- \"Hi just hasked to learn
        your custom hin case hi did lose hany.\" - An example of \"hi\" used in a
        sentence, although this example is somewhat unusual."}, "delta": {"role":
