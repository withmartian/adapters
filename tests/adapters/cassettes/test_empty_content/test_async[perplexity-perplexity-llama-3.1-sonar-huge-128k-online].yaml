        to indicate direct speech, quotations, and to set apart certain words or phrases
        from the rest of the text. Here are some key points about quotation marks:\n\n1.
        **Types of Quotation Marks**:\n   - **Single Quotation Marks**: Used primarily
        in British English for direct speech and titles, and in American English for
        quotes within quotes[1][3][5].\n   - **Double Quotation Marks**: Used primarily
        in American English for direct speech and titles, and in British English for
        quotes within quotes[1][3][5].\n\n2. **Usage**:\n   - **Direct Speech**: Quotation
        marks are used to enclose direct speech, indicating that the words are being
        quoted exactly as they were spoken[1][3][5].\n   - **Titles**: Quotation marks
        are used for titles of short works like poems, songs, and short stories, while
        italics are used for longer works like books and films[3][5].\n   - **Unusual
        Usage**: Quotation marks can be used to indicate that a word or phrase is
        being used in an unusual or ironic way, often referred to as \"scare quotes\"[2][5].\n\n3.
        **Punctuation**:\n   - **American English**: Commas and periods are placed
        inside quotation marks, unless they are part of the original quotation[3][5].\n   -
        **British English**: Punctuation marks are placed outside quotation marks,
        unless they are part of the original quotation[3][5].\n\n4. **Consistency**:\n   -
        It is important to be consistent in the use of single or double quotation
        marks throughout a text, following the conventions of either American or British
        English[3][5].\n\n### References:\n1. **BYJU''S** - https://byjus.com/english/quotation-marks/\n2.
