        "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears you might be referring
        to quotation marks, which are punctuation marks used to set off quotations,
        direct speech, and titles of creative works. Here are the key points about
        quotation marks:\n\n### Definition and Usage\n- **Purpose**: Quotation marks
        are used to indicate that the words or phrases they surround are being quoted,
        either from direct speech or from written material[1][2][3].\n- **Types**:
        There are two main types of quotation marks: single (\u2018 \u2019) and double
        (\u201c \u201d). The choice between them often depends on the region (US English
        typically uses double, while UK English uses single)[1][3][4].\n\n### Functions\n-
        **Direct Speech**: Double quotation marks are commonly used to quote someone
        directly, as in: \u201cI had a dream,\u201d said Martin Luther King[1][3].\n-
        **Titles**: Single quotation marks are often used for titles of small works
        like poems or songs, while double quotation marks are used for longer works
        like books or films[3][4].\n- **Emphasis**: Quotation marks can also be used
        to emphasize a word or phrase, although this is generally considered stylistic
        and should be used sparingly to avoid confusion[2][5].\n\n### Rules and Exceptions\n-
        **Punctuation Placement**: In US English, punctuation marks like commas and
        periods are placed inside the quotation marks. In UK English, punctuation
        marks are typically placed outside the quotation marks unless they are part
        of the original quotation[3][4].\n- **Nested Quotes**: When using nested quotes
        (a quote within a quote), the opposite style of quotation marks is used. For
        example, in US English, double quotation marks are used for the main quote,
        and single quotation marks for the nested quote[3][4].\n\n### Special Cases\n-
        **Scare Quotes**: These are quotation marks used around words that are not
        direct quotations but are used in an unusual or ironic way. They indicate
        skepticism about the term or its usage[2][4][5].\n\nUnderstanding these rules
        and functions can help you use quotation marks correctly in your writing."},
