        a byte is a unit of digital information that typically consists of eight bits.
        The term \"byte\" is often used interchangeably with \"octet,\" particularly
        in contexts where the exact size of the unit is important. However, the two
        terms are not always equivalent, as an octet is always eight bits, while a
        byte may consist of a different number of bits in certain contexts.\n\nIn
        modern computing, a byte is most commonly used to represent a single character
        of text, such as a letter, digit, or punctuation mark. This is because a byte
        is large enough to represent the entire set of ASCII characters, which includes
        128 different characters.\n\nThe size of a byte is an important concept in
        computing because it is used to measure the size of digital files, memory,
        and storage devices. For example, a file that is 100 kilobytes in size is
        made up of 100,000 bytes, while a hard drive that has a capacity of 1 terabyte
        can store approximately 1 trillion bytes of data.\n\nOverall, the byte is
        a fundamental unit of digital information that is used to represent and store
        data in modern computing systems.","tool_calls":null},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null,"asr_results":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":32,"total_tokens":288,"completion_tokens":256}}'
