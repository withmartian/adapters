        "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Quotation marks are an essential
        part of punctuation in English, serving several key functions. Here are the
        main points to understand their usage:\n\n## Types of Quotation Marks\nThere
        are two types of quotation marks: single (`\u2018...\u2019`) and double (`\u201c...\u201d`).\n\n###
        Single Quotation Marks\n- In British English, single quotation marks are commonly
        used for direct speech, titles of works, and specific terms[3][5].\n- In American
        English, single quotation marks are typically used for quotes within quotes[3][5].\n\n###
        Double Quotation Marks\n- In American English, double quotation marks are
        primarily used for direct speech, quoting someone''s exact words, and titles
        of short works like poems or articles[3][5].\n- In British English, double
        quotation marks are used for quotes within quotes[3][5].\n\n## Usage\n###
        Direct Speech and Quotations\n- Quotation marks are used to indicate direct
        speech or to quote someone''s exact words. For example:\n  - \u201cI had a
        dream,\u201d said Martin Luther King[1].\n  - \u201cMy last boss used to always
        say, \u2018You sell more before lunch than the others sell in a week,\u2019
        \u201d Amira mentioned in her job interview[3].\n\n### Titles of Works\n-
        Quotation marks are used for the titles of short works such as poems, songs,
        or short stories. For example:\n  - We read \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d
        in class[3].\n- Long works like books, films, or stage plays are typically
        italicized rather than quoted[3].\n\n### Special or Unusual Usage\n- Quotation
        marks can indicate that a word or phrase is being used in an unusual, ironic,
        or borrowed sense. These are often referred to as \"scare quotes.\"\n  - The
        lunch lady plopped a glob of \"food\" onto my tray[2].\n\n### Nested Quotes\n-
        When a quote appears within another quote, the opposite type of quotation
        mark is used. For example:\n  - In American English: \u201cMy last boss used
        to always say, \u2018You sell more before lunch than the others sell in a
        week,\u2019 \u201d[3].\n\n## Punctuation Placement\n- In American English,
        commas and periods are placed inside the quotation marks unless they are not
        part of the original quotation[3][5].\n- In British English, punctuation marks
        are generally placed outside the quotation marks unless they are part of the
        original quotation[3][5].\n\n## Other Uses\n- Quotation marks can also be
        used to discuss a word as a word itself, to differentiate a nickname from
        a formal name, or to show that the validity of a word is in doubt[3].\n\nBy
        following these guidelines, you can ensure the correct use of quotation marks
        in your writing."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
