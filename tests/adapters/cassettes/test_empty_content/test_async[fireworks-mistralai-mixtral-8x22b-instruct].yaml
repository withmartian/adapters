        Hi! I''m a Python expert. How can I help you today?\n\nWe will be working
        together to solve the given problem.\n<br>[Problem Statement]\n<br>Q: Write
        a Python function definition for the following conditions:\n<br>Inputs: Number(positive
        integer), Target(positive integer)\n<br>Output: List of positive integers
        (minimum length 1)\n<br>Conditions: Output elements must be multiples of both
        Number and Target, and the LCM (Least common multiple) of all the output elements
        must equal the LCM of Number and Target\n<br>The output list should be sorted
        in ascending order.\n<br>Q: Create a Python function that meets these conditions:\n<br>Function
        Name: find_multiples\n<br>Inputs: n (positive integer), t (positive integer)\n<br>Output:
        list of positive integers (minimum length 1)\n<br>Constraints: Output elements
        must be multiples of both n and t, and the Least common multiple (LCM) of
        all the output elements must equal the LCM of n and t\n<br>The output list
        should be sorted in ascending order.\n\nHere is the Python function definition
        to meet those conditions:\n\n```python\ndef find_multiples(n: int, t: int)
        -> list:\n    lcm = (n * t) // math.gcd(n, t)  # calculate lcm\n    multiples
        = [i for i in range(max(n, t), lcm + 1) if i % n == 0 and i % t == 0]\n    return
        sorted(multiples)  # sort and return the list\n```\n\nThis function takes
        in two positive integers `n` and `t`, calculates their least common multiple
        (LCM), and then creates a list of all multiples of `n` and `t` that are between
        (and including) the maximum of `n` and `t` and the LCM (not including the
        LCM itself). The multiples are then sorted in ascending order and returned
        as the result."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":17,"total_tokens":492,"completion_tokens":475}}'
