        Jessica!\nCinderella''s Royal Table is a wonderful choice for your breakfast.
        I enjoyed dining there and the kids really had a blast meeting the princesses
        as we enjoyed our meals!\nI also had the Mickey Pancakes when I dined there
        and they were big enough to share with a third person. If you would like,
        just order one set and split them. That should be fine with the servers!\nYou
