        I turned (my first penthouse apartment) into a studio and I would travel from
        there, most visiting radio stations and record companies in an fjord, hoping
        they would interview and sign me. After that (I would return to the apartment)
        and recorded for a week before leaving again. One day, while wealthy (I was
        financially supported by (radio), I was profiled in a major European magazine,
        and was even visited by their editorial team. One chief editor, who also happened
        to be a gifted lyricist, expressed an interest in working with me. I (lightly)
        kissed his hand, and over (a glass of strong Turkish tea), I pitched my plan
        for our first collaboration. He was doubtful but agreed that he would write
        the lyrics, and I would compose and sing the song. We agreed to meet after
        a week to present our work, and he asked me to come to (his studio near the
        Mediterranean). Since I was never too keen on a (straying) from my ritual
        due to my job and business life, I spent the days on board my fjord, sharing
        my home with a very non-musical yellow lab. Each night, about two or three
        hours before midnight, my yellow lab would appear near the middle windows
        of (my apartment) without a sound. I heard a quiet whistle, and her playful
        pups began to play (the faint melody I would compose two years later). I tried
        to compose the music as I had spent countless hours on board my fjord before.
        I would lose track of the hours and had to act immediately, those noble melodies
        needed to be captured now if I wanted to preserve the quality in their original
        form. Over the next few months, this repetitive performance continued, further
        perfecting several melodies that eventually laid the foundation of (my album).\")
