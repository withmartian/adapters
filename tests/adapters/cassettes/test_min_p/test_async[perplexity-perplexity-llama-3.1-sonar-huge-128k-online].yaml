        greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence or to initiate a conversation.
        Here are some key points about the word \"hi\":\n\n1. **Definition and Usage**:\n   -
        **Hi** is used as a casual greeting, more informal than \"hello.\" It is appropriate
        in all but the most formal circumstances[2][3].\n   - It can be used in various
        contexts, such as when meeting someone, passing by someone, or starting a
        conversation[1][3].\n\n2. **Etymology**:\n   - The first recorded reference
        to \"hi\" is attributed to a Kansas Native American in 1862, originally used
        to attract attention, likely a variant of Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy\"[4].\n\n3.
        **Examples**:\n   - **Hi** can be used in simple greetings like \"Hi, how
        are you doing?\" or \"Hi, there!\"[3].\n   - It can also be used in informal
        messages, such as \"Say hi to Gemma\"[3].\n\n4. **Cultural Context**:\n   -
        **Hi** is widely used in American English and has become a universal greeting
        in many cultures[2][4].\n\nIn summary, **hi** is a versatile and informal
        greeting that is commonly used in everyday interactions."}, "delta": {"role":
