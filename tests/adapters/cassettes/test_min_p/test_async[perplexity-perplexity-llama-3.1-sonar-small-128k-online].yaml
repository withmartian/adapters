        greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence, particularly in casual or
        familiar settings. It is commonly used in various English-speaking contexts
        to greet friends, family, or acquaintances. Here are some key points about
        \"hi\" from the sources:\n\n- **Definition**: \"Hi\" is used as an informal
        greeting, more casual than \"hello\" [2][3].\n- **Etymology**: The first recorded
        reference to \"hi\" in American English dates back to the speech of a Kansas
        Indian in 1862, likely a variant of Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy\" [4].\n-
        **Usage**: It is appropriate in most informal circumstances but not in very
        formal situations, such as meeting the Queen [2][3].\n- **Variations**: In
        some contexts, \"hi\" can be used as an interjection to call attention, similar
        to \"hey\" [4].\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile and widely used greeting
        that is suitable for a variety of social interactions."}, "delta": {"role":
