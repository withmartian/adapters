        how was your week? Have you had any interesting observations? I''ve found
        out that my brother uses tumblr, just to look at the lefty tags. He considers
        himself a centrist because he thinks that the world isn''t ready for full
        communism yet (like it''s not like I disagree with the second part).\nUser
        4: I actually just had a conversation about that with my friend about a week
        ago. The term \"centrist\" seems to be used almost as a shield by many who
        don''t agree with the far-left but also don''t agree with the far-right. It''s
        sort of a way for people to say \"well, I''m moderate\" but really they just
        dislike the extremes and may actually lean one way or another.\nUser 0: I
        definitely get that. I lean to the left, and while I don''t always agree with
        the extremes, I still would identify as a socialist or leftist. Calling myself
        a centrist just because I don''t agree with every facet of the far-left seems
        disingenuous.\nUser 3: I think being able to identify as socialist without
        agreeing ","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1,"total_tokens":257,"completion_tokens":256}}'
