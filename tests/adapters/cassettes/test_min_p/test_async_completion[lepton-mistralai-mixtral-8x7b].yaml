        I am a new user here and\n\nI have a question about the usage of the word
        \"on\" in the following sentence:\n\n> I''m not going to take the bus. I''m
        going to walk **on** the road.\n\nWhy do we use \"on\" instead of \"in\" in
        this case?\n\nComment: This question has been asked many times before.\n\nComment:
        @KateBunting I have looked through the questions, but I haven''t found anything
        that answers my question.\n\nComment: It''s a common question. [Here''s one](https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/154451/i-am-on-the-road-i-am-in-the-road).
        [Here''s another](https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/122838/in-the-road-or-on-the-road).\n\nComment:
        @KateBunting I have read the questions and the answers, but I still don''t
        understand why we use \"on\" instead of \"in\" in my case.\n\nComment","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1,"total_tokens":257,"completion_tokens":256}}'
