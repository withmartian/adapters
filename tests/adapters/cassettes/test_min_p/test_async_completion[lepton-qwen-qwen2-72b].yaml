        I have a problem with my program. I have a file that contains a list of names
        and their phone numbers. I want to write a program that reads the file and
        then prints the names and phone numbers. The problem is that when I run the
        program it only prints the last name and phone number. Can someone help me
        figure out what I''m doing wrong?\n\n```\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include
        <string>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n    ifstream fin;\n    fin.open(\"phonebook.txt\");\n    string
        name;\n    string phone;\n    while (fin >> name >> phone)\n    {\n        cout
        << name << \" \" << phone << endl;\n    }\n    fin.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\n\nYour
        program is almost correct, but there are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **File
        Format**: Ensure that the file `phonebook.txt` is formatted correctly. Each
        line should contain a name followed by a phone number, separated by whitespace
        (e.g., a space or tab).\n\n2. **Reading the File**: Your current code reads
        the file line by line, extracting the name and phone number on each iteration
        of the loop. If the file is formatted correctly, this should work as expected.\n\n3.
