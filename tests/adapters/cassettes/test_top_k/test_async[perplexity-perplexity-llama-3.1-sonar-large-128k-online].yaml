        used as a greeting, particularly in informal settings. Here are some key points
        about its usage and origin:\n\n## Usage\n- \"Hi\" is a common, casual greeting
        used to acknowledge someone''s presence, especially among people you know.
        It is less formal than \"hello\" and suitable for most everyday interactions[2][3][4].\n\n##
        Origin\n- The first recorded use of \"hi\" as a greeting is attributed to
        a Kansas Native American in the 1860s. It is believed to be a variant of the
        Middle English words \"hey\" and \"hy,\" which were used to attract attention[2][4].\n\n##
        Examples\n- It can be used in various contexts, such as \"Hi, there!\", \"Hi,
        how are you?\", or simply \"Hi, Lewis.\"[3].\n\n## Formality\n- While \"hi\"
        is appropriate for most casual interactions, it is generally not suitable
        for very formal situations, such as greeting royalty or in highly formal business
        settings[2].\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile and widely used informal greeting
        in English."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
