        Question: If x is a positive number such that x^4 is less than or equal to
        16, which of the following best describes the range of possible values for
        x^3? A) 0 less than or equal to x^3 less than or equal to 1 B) 0 less than
        or equal to x^3 less than or equal to 16^(3/4) C) 0 less than or equal to
        x^3 less than or equal to 4 C) 0 less than or equal to x^3 less than or equal
        to 8 D) 1 less than or equal to x^3 less than or equal to 16\n\nAnswer: The
        correct answer is B) 0 less than or equal to x^3 less than or equal to 16^(3/4).\n\nExplanation:
        We are given that x is a positive number and that x^4 is less than or equal
        to 16. To find the range of possible values for x^3, we first need to find
        the range of possible values for x.\n\nSince x is positive, we can take the
        fourth root of both sides of the inequality x^4 <=","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1,"total_tokens":257,"completion_tokens":256}}'
