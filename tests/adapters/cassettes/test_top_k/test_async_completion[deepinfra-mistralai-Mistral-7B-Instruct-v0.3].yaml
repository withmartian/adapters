        Laman (*~\\~* Bowl *~\\~*), as always: your explanations are always so easy
        to follow and I wasn''t sure whether I should post it here just shy of 0 votes,
        but here I am.\n\nI guess what I''m struggling with, is the action of wrapping
        for or in.\n\nI''d call it \"*winding out/wrapping around*\", with the action
        of the verb here being something like \"wrapping/twining that exists\", where
        *around* is a preposition identifying the direction to wrap in.\nMaybe *revolving
        tightly around/around the edges* as the wrapping motion is similarly tight
        (Style of wrapping). But this doesn''t fit context as well, so I''m just going
        for your hint.\n\nSo do I arbitrarily pick out the preposition or is there
        a pattern in how verbs are related to these directions of motion?\n\nOr maybe
        also, because it''s possible to experience how it, Bear Stearns, is twined
        around/ wrapped around something (like a giant lilyplant), and one can forget
        it''s not a physical item and instead hypothetically use *around* as a directional,
        it''s why the preposition *around* is used\n\nOr is it possible this is me
        trying to overthink stuff?\n\nI''m interested in others'' input and thank
        you.\nUser 1: Hello once again, Laman Aphorism! I hope you''ve been having
        a lovely day. \n\nI don''t exactly process language grammatically, especially
        when it comes to vague verbs, so my answers won''t necessarily help you with
        explanation straight from your question, but I will explain the action and
        then perhaps we can infer together for your purpose of how to phrase it. \n\n\"Wrapping
        around Edwards\" coming from \"a tightly wrapped lilgy plant\" - the essence,
        the motion being performed, as I''ve always thought of wrapping is the action
        of drawing something around something. So straightaway in my processing I
        think, \"What is being wrapped around Edwards?\" The answer is BearStearns,
        so logically BearStearns is being wrapped. \n\nIf we''re going for an action
        that *happens*, then I would phrase it as something like this:\n\n*BearStearns,
        a poorly managed investment bank","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1,"total_tokens":513,"completion_tokens":512,"estimated_cost":2.819e-05}}'
