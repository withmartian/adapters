        How do I make a strong password?\n\nTo create a strong password, follow these
        guidelines:\n- Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers,
        and special characters.\n- Make it at least 12 characters long.\n- Avoid using
        personal information such as your name, birthdate, or common words.\n- Consider
        using a passphrase, which is a sequence of words that are meaningful to you
        but hard for others to guess.\n- Use a different password for each account.\n-
        Enable multi-factor authentication whenever possible.\n\nExamples of strong
        passwords:\n- s7#kL9$ZrT3\n- whalePianoSunset#1\n- CorrectHorseBatteryStaple\n\nNever
        share your password with anyone, and avoid writing it down. Regularly update
        your passwords and consider using a reputable password manager to help you
        keep track of them.\n\nConfidence: 95%"},"finish_reason":"stop","logprobs":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":94,"completion_tokens":206,"total_tokens":300}}'
