        1: \n\nA pair of dice are rolled. What is the probability that the sum of
        the numbers rolled is divisible by 3?\n\nSolution:\nThere are a total of 6
        sides on each die, so there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling
        two dice. \n\nFor the sum to be divisible by 3, the possible combinations
        are:\n\n- (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2): Sum = 3\n- (1,3), (3,1): Sum = 4\n-
        (1,5), (5,1), (2,4), (4,2), (3,3): Sum = 6\n- (1,6), (6,1), (2,5), (5,2),
        (3,4), (4,3): Sum = 8\n- (2,6), (6,2), (1,5), (5,1), (3,5), (5,3), (4,4):
        Sum = 9\n- (3,5), (5,3): Sum = 10\n- (3,6), (6,3), (2,5), (5,2), (3,4), (4,3):
        Sum = 11\n- (4,5), (5,4): Sum = 14\n- (4,6), (6,4), (3,5), (5,3): Sum = 15\n-
        (5,6), (6,5), (2,5), (5,2): Sum = 16\n- (6,6): Sum = 12\n\nOut of these 15
        combinations with a sum divisible by 3, there are 6 outcomes where the sum
        is 3, 4 outcomes where the sum is 6, and 5 outcomes where the sum is 9. There
        are no other sums divisible by 3.\n\nSo, the probabilities for each case are:\n\n-
        P(Sum = 3): 6/36 = 1/6\n- P(Sum = 6): 4/36 = 1/9\n- P(Sum = 9): 5/36\n\nTo
        find the overall probability of the sum being divisible by 3, we add the probabilities
        for each case:\n\nP(Sum divisible by 3) = P(Sum = 3) +"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":19,"completion_tokens":512,"total_tokens":531}}'
