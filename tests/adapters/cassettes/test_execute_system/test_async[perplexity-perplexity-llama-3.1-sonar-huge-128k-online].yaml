        word \"hi\" is a common, informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s
        presence or to initiate a conversation. Here are some key points about \"hi\":\n\n1.
        **Definition and Usage**:\n   - **Hi** is used as an exclamation of greeting,
        similar to \"hello\" but more casual.\n   - It is appropriate in all but the
        most formal circumstances.\n   - It can also be used to attract attention.\n\n2.
        **Etymology**:\n   - The origin of \"hi\" is traced back to late Middle English,
        possibly as a variant of \"hey\" or \"hy\" (circa 1475).\n   - The first recorded
        reference to \"hi\" as a greeting is attributed to a Kansas Indian in 1862.\n\n3.
        **Variations and Related Terms**:\n   - \"Hi\" can be used in various forms
        such as \"hiya\" and \"howdy,\" but \"hi\" is the most common.\n   - It is
        also used in hyphenated terms like \"hi-fi\" (high fidelity) and \"hi-def\"
        (high definition).\n\n4. **Examples**:\n   - \"Hi, there!\" and \"Hi, how
        are you doing?\" are common ways to use \"hi\" in greetings.\n   - It can
        be used in casual contexts, such as saying \"hi\" to someone you pass on the
        street or to staff in shops.\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile and widely
        used greeting that is suitable for most informal interactions."}, "delta":
