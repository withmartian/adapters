        term \"hi\" is primarily used as a casual and informal greeting. Here are
        some key points about its usage and origins:\n\n- **Greeting**: \"Hi\" is
        a common, informal way to greet someone, often used in place of \"hello\"
        in casual settings.\n- **Origin**: The word \"hi\" has its roots in late Middle
        English, possibly as a variant of \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which were used to attract
        attention.\n- **Usage**: It is suitable for most everyday interactions but
        may be too casual for very formal situations.\n- **Pronunciation**: The pronunciation
        is /ha\u026a/ in both American and British English.\n\nIn summary, \"hi\"
        is a friendly and casual greeting that is widely used in everyday conversations."},
