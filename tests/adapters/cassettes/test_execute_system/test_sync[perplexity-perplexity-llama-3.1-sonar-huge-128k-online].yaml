        term \"hi\" is primarily used as an informal greeting, similar to \"hello\"
        but more casual. Here are some key points about its usage and origins:\n\n1.
        **Greeting**: \"Hi\" is used to greet people, especially those you know or
        in informal settings.\n2. **Etymology**: It originated from Middle English
        \"hy\" or \"hey,\" which was used to attract attention. The first recorded
        reference to \"hi\" as a greeting is attributed to a Kansas Indian in 1862.\n3.
        **Usage**: \"Hi\" is appropriate in most casual and informal situations but
        may not be suitable for very formal occasions.\n4. **Variations**: It can
        also be used to express wonder or derision, though this usage is less common
        and somewhat dated.\n5. **Other meanings**: \"Hi\" can be an abbreviation
        for \"Hawaii\" or \"heat index\" in meteorology, and it is used in hyphenated
        terms like \"hi-fi\" to mean high fidelity.\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile
        and widely used greeting that is appropriate in many everyday situations."},
