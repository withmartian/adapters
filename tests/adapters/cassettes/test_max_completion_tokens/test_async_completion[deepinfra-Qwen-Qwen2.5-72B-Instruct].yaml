        there i am trying to cross compile my c project for arm v6 which appears to
        have been successful, i''ve not seen any compilation errors in the target
        ./build\\_dir section. So when i scp all of the project files over to a rooted
        raspberry pi and run the program i get a segfault, followed by a core dump.\n\nThe
        program compiles without issue on the raspberry pi so i don''t think it''s
        a project sourced segfault, what are the possible issues that could be causing
        this? I''m using a custom SDK to do the cross compilation and have never had
        much experience with embedded development but from my vantage point it would
        appear to all be ticking along nicely and likely user error? I can''t be sure
        though. \n\nThere''s no specific error beyond glibc detected \\*\\* double
        free or corruption (!prev). Which i understand could be anything so if there''s
        any other suggestions to help me debug this would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!\nCross-compiling
        can be tricky, and there are several potential issues that might be causing
        the segmentation fault on the Raspberry Pi. Here are some common issues and
        steps you can take to debug and resolve the problem:\n\n### 1. **Library Differences**\n   -
        **Ensure Compatibility**: Make sure that all the libraries your program depends
        on are available on the Raspberry Pi and are compatible with the ARMv6 architecture.\n   -
        **Check versions**: Ensure that the versions of the libraries used during
        cross-compilation match those on the Raspberry Pi.\n\n### 2. **Toolchain Issues**\n   -
        **Check the Toolchain**: Ensure that the cross-compilation toolchain is correctly
        set up and configured for ARMv6. Sometimes, toolchain mismatches can lead
        to compatibility issues.\n   - **Verify Compilation Flags**: Double-check
        the compilation flags to ensure they are appropriate for ARMv6. For example,
        you might need to use `-march=armv6` or similar flags.\n\n### 3. **Binary
        Compatibility**\n   - **Static vs Dynamic**: If your program is dynamically
        linked, ensure that all required shared libraries are present on the Raspberry
        Pi. Consider building your program statically to avoid library issues.\n   -
        **Check Executable**: Use `file` to check the architecture of the compiled
        binary and ensure it is indeed for ARMv6:\n     ```sh\n     file your_program\n     ```\n     It
        should output something like:\n     ```\n     your_program: ELF 32-bit LSB
        executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked,","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1,"total_tokens":513,"completion_tokens":512,"estimated_cost":0.00020503}}'
