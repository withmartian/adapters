        greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence or to initiate a conversation.
        It is commonly used in casual settings and is more relaxed than formal greetings
        like \"hello.\" Here are some key points about \"hi\" from the sources:\n\n-
        **Definition**: \"Hi\" is used especially as a greeting, particularly in informal
        contexts[1][2][3].\n- **Etymology**: The first recorded reference to \"hi\"
        in American English dates back to the speech of a Kansas Indian in 1862, likely
        originating from Middle English variants like \"hey\" and \"hy\"[4].\n- **Usage**:
        It is appropriate in most social interactions except for the most formal circumstances,
        such as meeting the Queen[2].\n- **Synonyms**: Other informal greetings include
        \"hey,\" \"hello,\" \"hiya,\" and \"howdy\"[2].\n- **Pronunciation**: In American
        English, it is pronounced as /ha\u026a/ and in British English, it is pronounced
        as /ha\u026a/[3].\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is a versatile and widely used greeting
        that is suitable for most everyday interactions."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
