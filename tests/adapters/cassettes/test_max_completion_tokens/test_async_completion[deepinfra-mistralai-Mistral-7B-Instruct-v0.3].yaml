        though we don't have much track history through the Legislature it\u2019s
        promising to see Republicans addressing the shortcomings of the Federalist
        Society system and creating more transparent, accessible nominating processes
        with the Kansas Bar Association taking part.\\n\\nIf we hope to preserve our
        federal judiciary\u2019s perch as the least biased branch of our government
        then it begins with appointments based on merit. I am certainly glad to see
        the focus on that.\\n\\nI\u2019ve always subscribed to the saying \u201Clet
        us judge judges by their previous work as attorneys,\u201D and through the
        Bar's bipartisan judicial nominating procedure we continue to advocate for
        judges with significant, diverse legal experience rather than political leanings.\\n\\nAnd,
        in terms of your final question: If President Biden had established a similar
        bipartisan commission inclusive of our very own Kansas Bar Association for
        federal judicial nomination, I would have absolutely supported it.\\n\\nEditor's
