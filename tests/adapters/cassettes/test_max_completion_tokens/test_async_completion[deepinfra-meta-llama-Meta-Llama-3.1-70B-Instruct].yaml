        Tech systems, according to the introduction of Mobot.\_\\nDespite this, Loibl
        highlighted that Hidef Tech also carries out a series of high-resolution cameras
        for high-speed imaging applications. \u201CHowever, in addition to Mobot\u2019s
        vision inspection expertise, there\u2019s also the HiVision digital twin software
        platform, and more importantly, their in-depth knowledge of the packaging
        industry, specifically the development of machine learning algorithms for
        packaging inspection tasks,\u201D he mentioned.\\nIn response to this collaboration,
        Gordon Wong, managing director of Mobot Technology, said: \u201CTogether with
        HiDef, Mobot is well-positioned to offer an integrated vision inspection solution
        to packaging manufacturers across Asia and the world.\u201D Additionally,
        Mobot aims to further expand its technology offerings and increase its presence
        in the Asia-Pacific region with the help of HiDef.\_\\nThese emerging partnerships,
        as seen in the collaboration between Mobot and HiDef, reflect the growing
        market interest in more advanced and reliable vision inspection solutions
        in the manufacturing and packaging industries. As camera and vision technology
        continues to evolve, expect to see more innovation and partnerships in the
        future.\_ \_\\nMobot partners with HiDef to expand vision inspection solutions\\nMobot
