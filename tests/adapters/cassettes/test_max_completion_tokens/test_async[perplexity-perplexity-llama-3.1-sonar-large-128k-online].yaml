        used as an informal greeting in English. Here are some key points about its
        usage and origin:\n\n## Usage\n- \"Hi\" is a casual and friendly greeting,
        often used in informal settings. It is more casual than \"hello\" and is appropriate
        for most everyday interactions, except in very formal circumstances[2][3][4].\n\n##
        Origin\n- The first recorded use of \"hi\" as a greeting is attributed to
        a Kansas Native American in the 1860s. It is believed to be a variant of Middle
        English words like \"hey\" and \"hy\"[2][4].\n\n## Examples\n- It can be used
        in various contexts, such as \"Hi, there!\", \"Hi, how are you?\", or simply
        \"Hi, Lewis\"[3].\n\n## Etymology\n- The word \"hi\" has its roots in American
        English and was originally used to attract attention, similar to \"hey\"[4].\n\nOverall,
        \"hi\" is a versatile and common greeting that is widely used in informal
        communication."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
