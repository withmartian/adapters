        query seems to be about quotes related to the concept of \"empty.\" Here are
        some key points and quotes from the provided sources:\n\n1. **Literary Quotes**:\n   -
        **C. S. Lewis**: \"Into the void of silence, into the empty space of nothing,
        the joy of life is unfurled.\" This quote highlights the idea that even in
        emptiness, there can be a profound sense of joy and life.\n   - **Neil Gaiman**:
        \"All alone, in the middle of the night, Coraline began to cry. There was
        no other sound in the empty flat.\" This quote captures the loneliness and
        isolation that can be associated with emptiness.\n   - **Eugene Peterson**:
        \"The hard work of sowing seed in what looks like perfectly empty earth has,
        as every farmer knows, a time of harvest. All suffering, all pain, all emptiness,
        all disappointment is seed: sow it in God and he will, finally, bring a crop
        of joy from it.\" This quote suggests that emptiness can be a precursor to
        growth and joy.\n\n2. **Philosophical Quotes**:\n   - **Antonio Porchia**:
        \"In a full heart there is room for everything, and in an empty heart there
        is room for nothing.\" This quote contrasts the fullness and emptiness of
        the heart, emphasizing the importance of emotional fulfillment.\n   - **Taoist
        Philosophy**: \"Empty your mind of all thoughts. Let your heart be at peace.
        Watch the turmoil of beings, but contemplate their return. Each separate being
        in the universe returns to the common source. Returning to the source is serenity.\"
        This quote encourages a state of mental emptiness as a path to peace and understanding.\n\n3.
        **Technical Context**:\n   - **Empty Quotes in Programming**: In programming,
        empty quotes (`\"\"`) are used to indicate an empty string. This is a common
        practice to initialize a variable that will hold a string value.\n   - **CSV
        Files**: In CSV files, empty cells are typically represented by consecutive
        field separators (e.g., `data1;;data3`), but there are no standard means to
        quote empty cells. However, users can manually create empty text for cells
        using formulas like `=\"\"` to ensure they are quoted in CSV exports.\n\nThese
        sources cover various aspects of \"empty\" in literary, philosophical, and
        technical contexts."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
