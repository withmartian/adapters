        can I use a Python class to create a simple calculator? Here''s what I have
        so far:\n\n```python\nclass Calculator:\n\n    def add(self, x, y):\n        return
        x + y\n\n    def subtract(self, x, y):\n        return x - y\n\n    def multiply(self,
        x, y):\n        return x * y\n\n    def divide(self, x, y):\n        if y
        != 0:\n            return x / y\n        else:\n            return \"Error!
        Division by zero is not allowed.\"\n\ncalculator = Calculator()\nresult =
        calculator.add(5, 3)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIs this code correct? If not,
        what changes would you suggest?\n\nYes, this code is correct for a simple
        calculator class. One small improvement you could make is to pass the numbers
        to be operated on to the methods as arguments, instead of storing them as
        instance variables, like this:\n\n```python\nclass Calculator:\n\n    def
        add(self, x, y):\n        return x +","tool_calls":null},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":10,"total_tokens":266,"completion_tokens":256}}'
