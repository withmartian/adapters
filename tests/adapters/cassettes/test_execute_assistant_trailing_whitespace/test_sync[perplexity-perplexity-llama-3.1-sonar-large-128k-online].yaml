        you are looking for quotes related to the concept of \"empty,\" here are some
        notable ones from the sources provided:\n\n1. **Antonio Porchia**:\n   - \"In
        a full heart there is room for everything, and in an empty heart there is
        room for nothing.\"\n\n2. **C.S. Lewis**:\n   - \"Into the void of silence,
        into the empty space of nothing, the joy of life is unfurled.\"\n\n3. **Sylvia
        Plath**:\n   - \"I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado
        must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullaballoo.\"\n\n4.
        **Eugene Peterson**:\n   - \"The hard work of sowing seed in what looks like
        perfectly empty earth has, as every farmer knows, a time of harvest. All suffering,
        all pain, all emptiness, all disappointment is seed: sow it in God and he
        will, finally, bring a crop of joy from it.\"\n\n5. **George Macdonald**:\n   -
        \"Every little girl knows how dreadful it is to find a room empty where she
        thought somebody was.\"\n\nThese quotes capture various aspects of emptiness,
        ranging from emotional states to philosophical and poetic interpretations."},
