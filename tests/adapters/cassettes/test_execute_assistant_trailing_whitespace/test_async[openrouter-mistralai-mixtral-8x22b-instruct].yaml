        there, I think your very handsome! If you can understand this message, enter
        the Institute.\\n\\nAh, the joys of Fallout 4. So many interesting characters,
        so many weapons and so many quests. One could spend weeks, if not months,
        in the game and still find something they haven't done or seen yet. That's
        not even taking into account the modding scene: what it's probably the most
        moddable Bethesda game, there's almost no end to what can be done with some
        ingenuity and the Creation engine. Fallout 4 isn't all sunshine and gamma
        guns, though. Like all games, it has its flaws and...interesting choices,
        to say the least. Here are some of them, ranging from questionable design
        choices to notable bugs and glitches that have managed to stick around in
        the game since its release.\\n\\n## 15 RADIO JINGLES ARE LOUDER THAN GUNSHOTS\\n\\nWhen
        you're sneaking around a location filled with raiders, super mutants or gunners,
        you need to be extremely cautious. One wrong move and you could alert the
        guards, leading to a chaotic gunfight where you're heavily outnumbered. This
        is why stealth is key in these situations.\\n\\nHowever, sometimes you can
        do everything right: sneak behind cover, move slowly and avoid making noise...and
        then a radio jingle plays at max volume, alerting every enemy in the vicinity
        to your location. Sometimes the jingles are so loud you'd think a Deathclaw
        was sneaking up on you, not some random tune playing from a speaker. This
        can really mess up your stealth playthrough, and there's not much you can
        do about it.\\n\\n## 14 THE SAFE IN VALENTINE'S OFFICE\\n\\nNick Valentine
        is one of the best companions in the game, and his detective agency is a nice
        place to visit early in the game. You can even pick up a few quests and interesting
        items here if you take the time to look around.\\n\\nHowever, there's a safe
        in the detective agency that's glitched to the point where it's almost not
        worth trying to unlock. Even if you have the skills to unlock it, there's
        a good chance the game won't register your attempts and you'll just end up
        wasting your bobby pins. Some players have reported that simply reloading
        a save and trying again works, but this can often take more than a few tries.\\n\\n##
        13 YOU CAN'T REPAIR YOUR POWER ARMOR\\n\\nOne would assume that, with the
        amount of scrap and resources in the Commonwealth, you'd be able to fix up
        your Power Armor when it gets a bit too banged up. After all, if you can build
        entire settlements from scratch, surely repairing a few dents and scratches
        on your T-60 would be a piece of cake, right?\\n\\nUnfortunately, you can't
        repair Power Armor frames in Fallout 4. You can repair the individual pieces
        and even modify them to make them stronger, but the frame itself is permanent.
        If it gets too damaged, you're out of luck. You'll need to find a new one,
        or make do with what you have.\\n\\n## 12 THE MANY FACES OF CODSWORTH\\n\\nCodsworth,
        your Mr. Handy butler who's been with you since before the bombs dropped,
        is supposed to be a charming, lovable character. He's been programmed with
        various facial expressions to convey his current mood or feelings, which is
        a nice touch.\\n\\nHowever, sometimes Codsworth's face can glitch out and
        he'll be stuck with a particular expression permanently. This can lead to
        some rather...unnerving moments, such as him smiling maniacally while telling
        you about the horrors of the wasteland, or looking absolutely terrified while
        complimenting your latest crafting project. It's both hilarious and creepy
        at the same time.\\n\\n## 11 NOBODY NOTICES MISSING SETTLEMENT MEMBERS\\n\\nSettlements
        in Fallout 4 are a huge part of the game. You can build them up, attract new
        people to them and even defend them from raiders and other threats. It's a
        big responsibility, and you'd think the game would reflect that.\\n\\nHowever,
        the game doesn't really seem to care if a few settlers go missing. You could
        have an entire settlement's population disappear, and nobody would bat an
        eye. There's no search party, no investigation and certainly no consequences
        for your poor management skills. It's as if they never existed in the first
        place, which can really take you out of the experience.\\n\\n## 10 SUPER MUTANTS
        CAN BE A BIT...OBLIVIOUS\\n\\nSuper Mutants are one of the more dangerous
        enemy types in Fallout 4. They're big, they're strong and they have a penchant
        for lobbing molotovs at you when you least expect it. However, they're not
        the brightest bulbs in the wasteland, and their AI can sometimes reflect that.\\n\\nFor
        example, it's not uncommon to see a Super Mutant completely ignore a grenade
        that's just landed at their feet, or watch as they struggle to navigate the
        simplest of obstacles. They can also be easily fooled by the player character
        hiding behind a thin wall or piece of cover, even if it's clear that you're
        there.\\n\\n## 9 COMPANIONS CAN LOSE THEIR GEAR\\n\\nCompanions in Fallout
        4 are incredibly useful. They can carry extra gear for you, provide support
        in combat and even have their own unique abilities and perks. However, they
        can also be a bit...careless with their belongings.\\n\\nIt's not uncommon
        for companions to lose their equipped weapons and armor, especially if they've
        been dismissed and then re-recruited. This can be particularly frustrating
        if you've spent a lot of time and resources customizing their gear, only to
        find that it's vanished without a trace. There's no way to prevent this from
        happening, short of never dismissing your companions or changing their gear.\\n\\n##
        8 THE COMMONWEALTH IS SURPRISINGLY FLAMMABLE\\n\\nFallout 4 features a dynamic
        fire system that allows flames to spread realistically across different surfaces
        and materials. It's a nice touch that adds to the immersion and can be used
        to your advantage in combat.\\n\\nHowever, the Commonwealth can sometimes
        feel like it's made entirely of gasoline-soaked kindling. A single molotov
        can engulf an entire building in flames, and the fire can spread surprisingly
        quickly. This can lead to some unintentionally hilarious situations, such
        as accidentally setting a whole town on fire with a stray bullet, but it can
        also be a hindrance if you're trying to carefully navigate a flammable environment.\\n\\n##
        7 FUSION CORES ARE EVERYWHERE...BUT ALSO NOWHERE\\n\\nFusion Cores are an
        essential resource in Fallout 4, as they're required to power your Power Armor.
        Without them, your fancy suit of mechanized armor is little more than a glorified
        paperweight.\\n\\nThe game seems to acknowledge this, as Fusion Cores are
        fairly common and can be found in a variety of locations throughout the Commonwealth.
        However, they're also consumed surprisingly quickly, especially if you're
        using V.A.T.S. a lot or engaging in frequent combat. This can lead to a situation
        where you're constantly on the lookout for more Fusion Cores, even though
        they're technically not that rare.\\n\\n## 6 V.A.T.S. CAN BE A BIT...FINICKY\\n\\nV.A.T.S.
        (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) is a staple of the Fallout series, allowing
        players to pause time and target specific body parts of their enemies for
        increased damage or other effects. It's a useful tool, but it can also be
        frustratingly inconsistent.\\n\\nSometimes V.A.T.S. will inexplicably target
        an enemy that's already dead, or focus on a less threatening target while
        a Super Mutant Suicider is about to blow you to smithereens. It can also be
        difficult to hit moving targets, even if they're seemingly stationary from
        your perspective. These issues can make V.A.T.S. feel more like a gamble than
        a strategic tool.\\n\\n## 5 YOUR SETTLEMENTS AREN'T AS SAFE AS YOU THINK\\n\\nAs
        mentioned earlier, building and managing settlements is a big part of Fallout
        4. You can construct defenses, set up supply lines and attract new settlers
        to create a thriving community. However, the game's settlement system isn't
        without its flaws.\\n\\nOne of the most notable issues is that your settlements
        aren't as safe as you might think. Even with high defense ratings and plenty
        of turrets, it's not uncommon for raiders or other hostiles to spawn inside
        the settlement itself, wreaking havoc and causing chaos. This can be particularly
        frustrating if you're not around to deal with the threat, as it can lead to
        settlers getting killed and resources being destroyed.\\n\\n## 4 INFINITE
        MATERIAL GLITCH\\n\\nThis one is actually a glitch that can be exploited by
        the player, but it's worth mentioning due to its impact on the game's economy
        and crafting system. Essentially, there's a way to duplicate materials by
        transferring them between the workshop inventory and your own.\\n\\nWhile
        this can be useful if you're looking to amass a large quantity of resources
        quickly, it also breaks the game's balance and can make the already easy late-game
        a complete cakewalk. It's a testament to the game's complex systems and interconnected
        mechanics, but it's also something that can detract from the overall experience
        if abused.\\n\\n## 3 THE BROKEN FETCH QUESTS\\n\\nFallout 4 has its fair share
        of fetch quests, where you're tasked with retrieving a specific item or items
        for a quest giver. These quests can be straightforward and enjoyable, but
        they can also be incredibly frustrating if they don't work as intended.\\n\\nThere
        have been numerous reports of fetch quests glitching out, with the required
        items either not spawning or not being recognized by the game even if they're
        in the player's inventory. This can bring your progress to a complete halt
        and force you to resort to console commands or mods to bypass the issue.\\n\\n##
        2 SYNTH SETTLEMENTS\\n\\nThe Institute is one of the main factions in Fallout
        4, and their use of synthetic humans (synths) is a central theme throughout
        the game. However, the game's mechanics don't always align with the lore and
        backstory provided by the Institute.\\n\\nFor example, it's possible for synths
        to establish their own settlements in the Commonwealth, which doesn't make
        much sense given their origins and the Institute's modus operandi. It's a
        strange oversight that can break immersion, especially if you're role-playing
        as someone who's deeply involved with the Institute and its operations.\\n\\n##
        1 THE IMMORTAL DEATHCLAW\\n\\nDeathclaws are some of the most fearsome creatures
        in the Fallout series, and Fallout 4 is no exception. These monstrous beasts
        are incredibly tough, fast and deadly, making them a significant threat even
        to well-equipped players.\\n\\nHowever, there's a glitch that can make a Deathclaw
        effectively immortal. Sometimes, when a Deathclaw is killed, it will play
        its death animation and then simply get back up as if nothing happened. This
        can turn an already challenging encounter into an almost impossible battle,
        as the Deathclaw will just keep coming back no matter how many times you shoot
        it. It's a rare glitch, but it's one that can ruin an otherwise enjoyable
        playthrough.\",\"refusal\":\"\"}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":10,\"completion_tokens\":2700,\"total_tokens\":2710}}"
