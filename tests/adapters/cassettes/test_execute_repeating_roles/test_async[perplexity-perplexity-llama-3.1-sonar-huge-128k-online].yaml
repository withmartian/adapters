        term \"hi\" is primarily used as an informal greeting, similar to \"hello\"
        but more casual. Here are some key points about its usage and origins:\n\n1.
        **Usage**: \"Hi\" is used to greet people, especially those you know. It''s
        a friendly and informal way to acknowledge someone''s presence.\n\n2. **Etymology**:
        The word \"hi\" originated in the late Middle English period, possibly as
        a variant of \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which were used to attract attention. The
        first recorded reference to \"hi\" as a greeting is attributed to a Kansas
        Indian in 1862.\n\n3. **Pronunciation**: \"Hi\" is pronounced as /ha\u026a/
        in both American and British English.\n\n4. **Formality**: \"Hi\" is more
        casual than \"hello\" and is appropriate in all but the most formal circumstances.
        For example, it might not be suitable when greeting someone in a very formal
        setting, like meeting a monarch.\n\n5. **Variations**: There are other informal
        greetings similar to \"hi,\" such as \"hey,\" \"hello,\" \"hiya,\" and \"howdy,\"
        but \"hi\" is one of the most common.\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is a widely used,
        informal greeting that is appropriate in most casual and semi-formal contexts."},
