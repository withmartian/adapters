        term \"hi\" is primarily used as an informal greeting, similar to \"hello.\"
        Here are some key points about its usage and origins:\n\n- **Greeting**: \"Hi\"
        is a casual and friendly way to greet someone, often used among people who
        know each other.\n- **Origin**: The word \"hi\" has its roots in late Middle
        English, possibly as a variant of \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which were used to attract
        attention. The first recorded use of \"hi\" as a greeting dates back to the
        19th century, specifically attributed to a Kansas Native American in 1862.\n-
        **Usage**: It is appropriate in most informal settings but may not be suitable
        for very formal occasions.\n- **Pronunciation**: The word is pronounced as
        /ha\u026a/ in both American and British English.\n\nIn addition to its use
        as a greeting, \"hi\" can also be an exclamation to call attention or express
        surprise. However, its primary function remains as a casual greeting."}, "delta":
