        term \"hi\" is a common, informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s
        presence. Here are some key points about its usage and origins:\n\n- **Greeting**:
        \"Hi\" is an informal way to say \"hello\" and is often used as a casual greeting,
        especially among people who know each other.\n- **Origin**: The word \"hi\"
        has its roots in Middle English, possibly as a variant of \"hey\" or \"hy,\"
        which were used to attract attention. The first recorded reference to \"hi\"
        is attributed to a Kansas Native American in 1862.\n- **Usage**: It is appropriate
        in most casual settings but is generally avoided in formal situations.\n-
        **Pronunciation**: The word is pronounced as /ha\u026a/ in both American and
        British English.\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile and widely used greeting
        in everyday conversation."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
