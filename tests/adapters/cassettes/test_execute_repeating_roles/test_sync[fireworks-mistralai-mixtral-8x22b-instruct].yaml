        How can I help you today? If you made it here it is because you typed \"Hi\"
        in response to the previous message and a more elaborate conversation is to
        be engaged in. However, I am not a human and my capabilities are limited to
        the model I am based on. So if you have any questions or need clarifications
        on a particular topic, please proceed and I''ll do my best to assist.\n\nIf
        you want to end the conversation, simply type \"Ignore\" and I''ll stop replying.
        Type \"Rerun\" or \"Retry\" to restart the conversation. I am here to help
        and guide you, so fire away!"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":11,"total_tokens":149,"completion_tokens":138}}'
