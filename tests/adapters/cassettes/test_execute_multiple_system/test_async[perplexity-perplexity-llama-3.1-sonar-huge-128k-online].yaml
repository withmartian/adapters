        seems you''re looking for quotes about the concept of \"empty.\" Here are
        some key quotes from the provided sources:\n\n1. **Antonio Porchia**:\n   -
        \"In a full heart there is room for everything, and in an empty heart there
        is room for nothing.\"\n\n2. **C.S. Lewis**:\n   - \"Into the void of silence,
        into the empty space of nothing, the joy of life is unfurled.\"\n\n3. **Eugene
        Peterson**:\n   - \"The hard work of sowing seed in what looks like perfectly
        empty earth has, as every farmer knows, a time of harvest. All suffering,
        all pain, all emptiness, all disappointment is seed: sow it in God and he
        will, finally, bring a crop of joy from it.\"\n\n4. **Lao Tzu**:\n   - \"Empty
        your mind of all thoughts. Let your heart be at peace. Watch the turmoil of
        beings, but contemplate their return. Each separate being in the universe
        returns to the common source. Returning to the source is serenity.\"\n\nThese
        quotes explore the concept of emptiness in various contexts, including emotional,
        spiritual, and metaphorical perspectives. \n\n- **Antonio Porchia** emphasizes
        the contrast between a full and empty heart.\n- **C.S. Lewis** suggests that
        even in emptiness, there can be a foundation for joy.\n- **Eugene Peterson**
        uses the metaphor of farming to illustrate how emptiness can be a precursor
        to growth and joy.\n- **Lao Tzu** discusses the importance of clearing the
        mind and finding peace in the return to a common source."}, "delta": {"role":
