        seems like you might be asking for quotes about the concept of \"empty\" or
        perhaps something related to empty cells in CSV files. Here are some relevant
        quotes and information:\n\n### Quotes about \"Empty\"\n\n1. **Antonio Porchia**:
        \"In a full heart there is room for everything, and in an empty heart there
        is room for nothing.\" - This quote highlights the idea that an empty heart
        can be a void, lacking in content or meaning.\n\n2. **C. S. Lewis**: \"Into
        the void of silence, into the empty space of nothing, the joy of life is unfurled.\"
        - This quote suggests that even in emptiness, there can be a profound sense
        of joy and life.\n\n3. **Eugene Peterson**: \"The hard work of sowing seed
        in what looks like perfectly empty earth has, as every farmer knows, a time
        of harvest. All suffering, all pain, all emptiness, all disappointment is
        seed: sow it in God and he will, finally, bring a crop of joy from it.\" -
        This quote emphasizes the potential for growth and joy even in times of emptiness
        and suffering.\n\n### Quotes about Emptiness in Literature\n\n1. **Neil Gaiman**:
        \"All alone, in the middle of the night, Coraline began to cry. There was
        no other sound in the empty flat.\" - This quote from \"Coraline\" by Neil
        Gaiman captures the eerie feeling of being alone in an empty space.\n\n2.
        **Laurie Halse Anderson**: \"This closet is abandoned - it has no purpose,
        no name. It is the perfect place for me.\" - This quote from \"Speak\" by
        Laurie Halse Anderson highlights the sense of emptiness and abandonment.\n\n3.
        **Sylvia Plath**: \"I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a
        tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullaballoo.\"
        - This quote from \"The Bell Jar\" by Sylvia Plath describes a state of emotional
        emptiness and disconnection.\n\n### Handling Empty Cells in CSV Files\n\nIf
        you are dealing with CSV files and need to ensure that empty cells are properly
        quoted, you can use the following approach in LibreOffice:\n\n1. **Restrict
        Export to Range**: To keep quotes around empty cells, you need to restrict
        the export to a specific range. This is not currently possible through standard
        means in LibreOffice.\n\n2. **Explicitly Create Empty Text**: You can use
        a formula like `=\"\"` to create an empty text for cells you want to be quoted.
        This will ensure that these cells are properly quoted in the CSV file.\n\n3.
        **Custom Script**: You can use a custom script to replace empty cells with
        quoted empty text. For example, the following code snippet can be used to
        achieve this:\n   ```vba\n   Sub efficientPrepareUsedAreaOfSheetForFullyQuotedCSVexport(Optional
        pSheet)\n       If IsMissing(pSheet) Then pSheet = ThisComponent.CurrentController.ActiveSheet\n       cellCursor
        = pSheet.createCursor()\n       cellCursor.gotoStartOfUsedArea(False)\n       cellCursor.gotoEndOfUsedArea(True)\n       emptyRgs
        = cellCursor.queryEmptyCells()\n       For Each emptyRg In emptyRgs\n           ra
        = emptyRg.RangeAddress\n           With ra\n               topRow = emptyRg.SpreadSheet.getCellRangeByPosition(
        _\n                   .StartColumn, .StartRow, .EndColumn, .StartRow)\n               topLeftCell
        = topRow.getCellByPosition(0, 0)\n           End With\n           topLeftCell.Formula
        = \"=\"\"\"\"\"\n           topRow.fillAuto(1, 1)\n           emptyRg.fillAuto(0,
        1)\n       Next emptyRg\n   End Sub\n   ```\n   This script will replace all
        empty cells with `=\"\"` and ensure they are quoted in the CSV file.\n\nThese
        methods should help you manage empty cells and quotes in your CSV files effectively."},
