        concept of \"empty\" can be interpreted in various contexts, each with its
        own set of meanings and implications. Here are some key points from the sources
        provided:\n\n1. **Literary Context**:\n   - In literature, \"empty\" often
        symbolizes emotional states, physical spaces, or philosophical concepts. For
        example:\n     - Neil Gaiman''s \"Coraline\" describes an \"empty flat\" to
        convey loneliness and fear.\n     - C.S. Lewis talks about finding joy in
        the \"empty space of nothing\".\n     - Donna Tartt''s \"The Goldfinch\" describes
        grief as leaving a \"brackish wreck\" that feels \"heartsick and empty\".\n\n2.
        **Philosophical and Spiritual Context**:\n   - Philosophically, an \"empty
        mind\" can be seen as a state of purity and acceptance, as described in quotes
        about the Tao and mindfulness.\n   - It can also symbolize a lack of purpose
        or fulfillment, such as in Laurie Halse Anderson''s \"Speak\" where a character
        finds solace in an abandoned closet.\n\n3. **Technical Context**:\n   - In
        data handling, \"empty\" cells in a spreadsheet or CSV file can pose challenges.
        For instance, LibreOffice does not have a standard option to quote empty cells
        when exporting to CSV, which can lead to inconsistencies in data formatting.\n\n4.
        **General Quotes**:\n   - Quotes about emptiness often touch on themes of
        sadness, loss, and the search for meaning. For example, \"In a full heart
        there is room for everything, and in an empty heart there is room for nothing\"
        by Antonio Porchia.\n\nEach context provides a unique perspective on what
        it means to be \"empty,\" whether it is a physical space, an emotional state,
        or a philosophical concept."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
