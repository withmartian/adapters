        quotes you''re referring to are likely from various sources discussing the
        concept of emptiness, whether it''s in a philosophical, literary, or practical
        context. Here are some relevant quotes:\n\n1. **Philosophical Perspective**:\n   -
        \"The empty mind - the pure mind - is not a blank, zero-land, where you''re
        not feeling or caring about anything. It''s an effulgence of the mind. It''s
        a brightness that is truly sensitive and accepting. It''s an ability to accept
        life as it is.\" - From a quote about the empty mind, emphasizing its sensitivity
        and acceptance.\n\n2. **Literary Quotes**:\n   - \"Into the void of silence,
        into the empty space of nothing, the joy of life is unfurled.\" - C. S. Lewis.\n   -
        \"I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel,
        moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullaballoo.\" - Sylvia
        Plath.\n\n3. **Practical Contexts**:\n   - \"If you focus on the hurt, you
        will continue to suffer. If you focus on the lesson, you will continue to
        grow.\" - A quote often used in bullet journaling for reflecting on empty
        spaces and focusing on growth.\n\nThese quotes capture different aspects of
        emptiness, from philosophical and literary perspectives to practical reflections."},
