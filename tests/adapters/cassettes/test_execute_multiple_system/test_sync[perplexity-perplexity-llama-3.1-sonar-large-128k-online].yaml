        address your query about quotes related to the concept of \"empty,\" here
        are some insightful and diverse quotes gathered from various sources:\n\n1.
        **C. S. Lewis**:\n   - \"Into the void of silence, into the empty space of
        nothing, the joy of life is unfurled.\"\n\n2. **Neil Gaiman**:\n   - \"All
        alone, in the middle of the night, Coraline began to cry. There was no other
        sound in the empty flat.\"\n\n3. **Laurie Halse Anderson**:\n   - \"This closet
        is abandoned - it has no purpose, no name. It is the perfect place for me.\"\n\n4.
        **Donna Tartt**:\n   - \"But sometimes, unexpectedly, grief pounded over me
        in waves that left me gasping; and when the waves washed back, I found myself
        looking out over a brackish wreck which was illumined in a light so lucid,
        so heartsick and empty, that I could hardly remember that the world had ever
        been anything but dead.\"\n\n5. **Sylvia Plath**:\n   - \"I felt very still
        and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along
        in the middle of the surrounding hullaballoo.\"\n\n6. **Eugene Peterson**:\n   -
        \"The hard work of sowing seed in what looks like perfectly empty earth has,
        as every farmer knows, a time of harvest. All suffering, all pain, all emptiness,
        all disappointment is seed: sow it in God and he will, finally, bring a crop
        of joy from it.\"\n\n7. **Antonio Porchia**:\n   - \"In a full heart there
        is room for everything, and in an empty heart there is room for nothing.\"\n\nThese
        quotes reflect various perspectives on emptiness, ranging from the emotional
        and psychological to the philosophical and spiritual."}, "delta": {"role":
