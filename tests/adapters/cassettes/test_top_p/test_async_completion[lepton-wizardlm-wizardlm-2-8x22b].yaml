        I''m a newbie to this forum and I''m currently working on a project that involves
        the use of a PIC microcontroller to control a stepper motor. I''m using the
        PIC16F877A and I''m trying to interface it with the ULN2003 driver to control
        a 5V, 4-phase unipolar stepper motor.\n\nI''ve written a simple program in
        MPLAB X IDE using the XC8 compiler to generate the step sequence for the motor,
        but I''m having trouble understanding how to properly connect the PIC to the
        ULN2003 and then to the stepper motor.\n\nHere''s what I''ve done so far:\n\n1.
        Connected the 4 output pins of the PIC (RC0-RC3) to the inputs of the ULN2003
        (1A-1D).\n2. Connected the COM pin of the ULN2003 to the ground of the power
        supply that''s providing 5V to the motor.\n3. Connected the 4 outputs of the
        ULN2003","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1,"total_tokens":257,"completion_tokens":256}}'
