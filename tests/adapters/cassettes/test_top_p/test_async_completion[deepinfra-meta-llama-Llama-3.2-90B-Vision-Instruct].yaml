        is\n\n## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the number
        of positive integers less than or equal to 100 that are divisible by 2 or
        3.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of integers divisible by 2\nWe start
        by finding the number of positive integers less than or equal to 100 that
        are divisible by 2. This can be calculated by dividing 100 by 2, which gives
        us 50.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of integers divisible by 3\nNext,
        we find the number of positive integers less than or equal to 100 that are
        divisible by 3. This can be calculated by dividing 100 by 3 and taking the
        floor of the result, which gives us 33.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number
        of integers divisible by both 2 and 3\nHowever, we have counted the integers
        that are divisible by both 2 and 3 twice. To correct this, we need to subtract
        the number of integers that are divisible by both 2 and 3. This can be calculated
        by dividing 100 by the least common multiple of 2 and 3, which is 6, and taking
        the floor of the result, which gives us 16.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total
        number of integers divisible by 2 or 3\nFinally, we add the number of integers
        divisible by 2 and the number of integers divisible by 3, and then subtract
        the number of integers divisible by both 2 and 3. This gives us 50 + 33 -
        16 = 67.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{67}$","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1,"total_tokens":342,"completion_tokens":341,"estimated_cost":0.00013675000000000002}}'
