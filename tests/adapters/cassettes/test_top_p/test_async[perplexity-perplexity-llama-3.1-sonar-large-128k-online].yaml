        used as a casual and informal greeting. Here are some key points about its
        usage and origin:\n\n## Usage\n- \"Hi\" is a common, friendly greeting that
        is more casual than \"hello\"[2][3][4].\n- It is appropriate in most social
        situations, except for very formal circumstances[2].\n\n## Origin\n- The first
        recorded reference to \"hi\" as a greeting is attributed to a Kansas Native
        American in the 1860s. It is believed to be a variant of Middle English words
        like \"hey\" and \"hy,\" which were used to attract attention[2][4].\n\n##
        Examples\n- It can be used in various contexts, such as \"Hi, there!\", \"Hi,
        how are you?\", or simply \"Hi, Ben\"[3].\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile
        and widely used greeting in informal settings."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
