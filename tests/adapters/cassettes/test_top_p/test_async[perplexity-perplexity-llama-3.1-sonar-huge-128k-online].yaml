        used as an informal greeting, especially to people you know. Here are some
        key points about its usage and meaning:\n\n1. **Informal Greeting**: \"Hi\"
        is a casual way to greet someone, more informal than \"hello.\" It''s commonly
        used in everyday interactions, especially with friends and acquaintances[2][3].\n\n2.
        **Etymology**: The first recorded reference to \"hi\" as a greeting is attributed
        to a Kansas Native American in the 1800s. It is believed to be a variant of
        the Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which was used to attract attention[2][4].\n\n3.
        **Usage Examples**: \"Hi\" can be used in various contexts, such as \"Hi,
        there!\", \"Hi, how are you doing?\", or simply \"Hi\" as a standalone greeting[3].\n\n4.
        **Formality**: While \"hi\" is generally informal, it''s appropriate in most
        casual and semi-formal situations. However, it might not be suitable for very
        formal occasions, such as meeting a dignitary[2].\n\n5. **Variations**: Other
        greetings similar to \"hi\" include \"hey,\" \"hello,\" \"hiya,\" and \"howdy,\"
        but \"hi\" is one of the most commonly used[2].\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is a
        versatile and widely used greeting that is suitable for most casual interactions."},
