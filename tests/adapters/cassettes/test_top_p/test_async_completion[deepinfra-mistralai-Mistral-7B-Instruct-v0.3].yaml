        2 XL, press and hold the power button until the power off option appears,
        then tap on it and confirm. Wait for the device to turn off, then press and
        hold the power button again to turn it back on.\n\n2. Check for updates: Make
        sure your Pixel 2 XL is running the latest software version. To check for
        updates, go to Settings > System > Advanced > System update. If an update
        is available, follow the on-screen instructions to download and install it.\n\n3.
