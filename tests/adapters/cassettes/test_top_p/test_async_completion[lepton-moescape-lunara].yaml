        I''m new to the forum and have a question. I''m a 21 year old male and have
        been having pain in my left testicle for the last 2 weeks. It''s not a sharp
        pain but more of a dull ache. I have not had any discharge or pain when urinating.
        I have also not had any pain in my lower back or abdomen. I have been taking
        ibuprofen to help with the pain but it doesn''t seem to be helping much. I''m
        not sure if I should go to the doctor or not. Any advice would be appreciated.\nUser
        0: You should go to the doctor. It could be a number of things, but it''s
        better to get it checked out. It could be a sign of something serious.\nUser
        1: Thanks for the advice. I''m a bit nervous about going to the doctor, but
        I know it''s the right thing to do. Do you think it''s likely to be something
        serious?\nUser 0: It''s hard to say without more information. But pain in
        the testicles can be a sign of a number of things, some of which are serious.
        It''s always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health.","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1,"total_tokens":255,"completion_tokens":254}}'
