        used as a greeting, particularly in informal settings. Here are some key points
        about its usage and origin:\n\n## Usage\n- \"Hi\" is a common, casual greeting,
        often used to acknowledge someone''s presence or to initiate a conversation.
        It is more informal than \"hello\" and suitable for most everyday interactions,
        except in very formal situations[2][3][4].\n\n## Origin\n- The first recorded
        use of \"hi\" as a greeting is attributed to a Kansas Native American in the
        1860s. It is believed to be a variant of the Middle English words \"hey\"
        and \"hy,\" which were used to attract attention around 1475[2][4].\n\n##
        Examples\n- It can be used in various contexts, such as \"Hi, there!\", \"Hi,
        how are you?\", or simply \"Hi, Lewis.\"[3].\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile
        and widely used informal greeting in American English."}, "delta": {"role":
