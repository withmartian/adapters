        used as an informal greeting, often to people you know. Here are some key
        points about its usage and origins:\n\n1. **Informal Greeting**: \"Hi\" is
        a casual way to greet someone, more informal than \"hello.\" It''s commonly
        used in everyday interactions, except in very formal situations[2][3].\n\n2.
        **Origin**: The first recorded reference to \"hi\" as a greeting is attributed
        to a Kansas Native American in 1862. It is believed to be a variant of the
        Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which was used to attract attention around
        1475[4].\n\n3. **Usage**: \"Hi\" can be used in various contexts, such as
        saying \"Hi, there!\" or \"Hi, how are you doing?\" It''s a versatile greeting
        that fits most casual interactions[3].\n\n4. **Cultural Context**: In small
        towns, it''s common for people to greet each other with \"hi\" as they pass
        by, reflecting its widespread use in informal settings[2].\n\n5. **Variations**:
        Other greetings like \"hey,\" \"hello,\" \"hiya,\" and \"howdy\" are also
        used, but \"hi\" remains one of the most common and widely accepted greetings[2].\n\nIn
        summary, \"hi\" is a friendly, informal greeting that is appropriate in most
        casual situations, with its origins tracing back to the 19th century in the
        United States."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
