        a 25-year-old male, and I've been experiencing some weird symptoms lately.
        I've been having a lot of anxiety and feeling really overwhelmed, and I've
        also been having some weird physical symptoms like numbness in my hands and
        feet, and a weird tingling sensation in my face. I've also been having some
        trouble sleeping and I've been feeling really fatigued. I've been to see my
        doctor, and she's run some tests, but so far, everything has come back normal.
        She's suggested that I might be experiencing anxiety, but I'm not so sure.
        I'm worried that there might be something more going on that she's not catching.
        Do you think I should get a second opinion?\",\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\",\n
