        know it seems like a crazy question\u2026but what was it you were thinking
        of\u2026saying to me last night\u2026?\u201D Her eyes searched his, probing,
        wanting, but then she glanced away.\\n\\nHis eyebrows rose in surprise at
        the question. He knew, of course, that it was something important. But to
        think out loud\u2026in front of her? That was pushing it. Still, a part of
        him yearned to give her what she wanted, to take this chance.\\n\\n\u201CI
        was just thinking\u2026that you seemed so\u2026nice.\u201D God, that sounded
        so weak. \u201CThat I hadn\u2019t had a really good talk with someone in a
        while. That maybe we should do it again sometime. You know\u2026\u201D he
        trailed off lamely, still not looking at her, his heart hammering at his own
        boldness. He could feel the flush creeping up his neck.\\n\\nThere was a silence,
        and he tensed, wondering if he had made a huge mistake, if she was laughing
        on the inside. Then slowly, hesitantly, her hand reached out to take his,
        and she met his eyes.\\n\\n\u201CI\u2026I\u2019d really like that,\u201D she
        said softly. \u201CI thought maybe we had a connection\u2026or something\u2026I
        don\u2019t know.\",\"logprobs\":null,\"finish_reason\":\"length\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1,\"total_tokens\":257,\"completion_tokens\":256}}"
