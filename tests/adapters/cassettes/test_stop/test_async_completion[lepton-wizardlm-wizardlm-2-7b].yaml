        Q. Can you tell me about your experience with the Surgical Technologist program
        at your school?\n\nA. Absolutely! The Surgical Technologist program at my
        school was a comprehensive and rigorous training experience that prepared
        me for a career in the operating room. The program was designed to provide
        students with both the theoretical knowledge and practical skills necessary
        to function effectively as part of the surgical team.\n\nHere are some key
        aspects of the program:\n\n1. **Curriculum**: The curriculum covered a wide
        range of topics, including anatomy and physiology, microbiology, pharmacology,
        surgical procedures, and patient care. We also learned about the ethical and
        legal aspects of surgical technology.\n\n2. **Clinical Experience**: A significant
        part of the program was dedicated to clinical rotations. This hands-on experience
        was invaluable as it allowed us to work alongside experienced surgical technologists
        and surgeons. We were exposed to various surgical specialties, which helped
        us understand the different demands and environments within the field.\n\n3.
        **Skill Development**: We practiced a variety of skills, from basic scrub
        techniques to more advanced tasks like assisting with organ transplants","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1,"total_tokens":257,"completion_tokens":256}}'
