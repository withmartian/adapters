        I have a table, where the first column of the table is a series of numbers.
        I have a script that is looping through each row of this table, and if it
        finds a number that meets a certain criteria, then it changes the background
        of that row to red.\n\nHowever, I would also like to change the font color
        of the number (in the first column of the table) to be red. I am doing this
        in the same function, but I am only able to change the entire row''s background
        to be red. I am unsure how to change the text color of the first cell in the
        row. Is there a way to target the first cell in each row? Here is a snippet
        of my code: \n\n```\nfor(i=0; i <= rows.length; i++)\n{\n    var row = rows[i];\n    if(row)\n    {\n        var
        num = row.getElementsByTagName(\"td\")[0];\n        var num = Number(num.innerHTML);\n        var
        rowId = row.getAttribute(\"id\");\n        var rowClass = row.className;\n\n        if(num
        === 0)\n        {\n            row.style.backgroundColor = \"red\";\n            document.getElementById(rowId).innerHTML.style.color
        = \"red\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe following line of code is changing
