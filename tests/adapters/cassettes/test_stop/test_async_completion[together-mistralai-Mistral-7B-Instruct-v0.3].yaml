        here. I'm trying to make a simple game using the Unity engine. I'm using the
        2D version of the engine. I'm trying to make a simple game where the player
        can move left and right and jump. I've been following a tutorial on YouTube
        and I've been able to get the player to move left and right, but I can't get
        the player to jump. I've tried following the tutorial's instructions, but
        I'm still having trouble. Here's my code:\\n\\n```\\nusing System.Collections;\\nusing
        System.Collections.Generic;\\nusing UnityEngine;\\n\\npublic class PlayerController
        : MonoBehaviour\\n{\\n    public float speed = 5f;\\n    public float jumpForce
        = 10f;\\n\\n    private Rigidbody2D rb;\\n    private bool isGrounded;\\n\\n
        \   void Start()\\n    {\\n        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();\\n    }\\n\\n
        \   void Update()\\n    {\\n        float move = Input.GetAxis(\\\"Horizontal\\\");\\n
        \       rb.velocity = new Vector2(move * speed, rb.velocity.y);\\n\\n        isGrounded
        = Physics2D.OverlapCircle(transform.position, 0.1f, LayerMask.GetMask(\\\"Ground\\\"));\\n\\n
        \       if (Input.GetButtonDown(\\\"Jump\\\") && isGrounded)\\n        {\\n
        \           rb.AddForce(new Vector2(0f, jumpForce), ForceMode2D.Impulse);\\n
        \       }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nI've tried changing the jumpForce variable
        to different values, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I've also tried
        changing the LayerMask in the Physics2D.OverlapCircle function, but that doesn't
        seem to make a difference either. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Any help
        would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\nComment: Have you tried to debug the code?
        Is the `isGrounded` variable true when you press the jump button?\\n\\nComment:
        I haven't tried debugging the code yet, but I'll give it a try. Thanks for
        the suggestion.\\n\\nComment: I've tried debugging the code and it looks like
        the isGrounded variable is always false, even when the player is standing
        on the ground. I'm not sure why that is.\\n\\nComment: I've also tried changing
        the size of the circle in the OverlapCircle function, but that doesn't seem
        to make a difference either.\\n\\nComment: I've also tried adding a collider
        to the ground object, but that didn't seem to make a difference either.\\n\\nComment:
        I've also tried changing the LayerMask to include other layers, but that didn't
        seem to make a difference either.\\n\\nComment: I've also tried changing the
        gravity scale in the Rigidbody2D component, but that didn't seem to make a
        difference either.\\n\\nComment: I've also tried changing the size of the
        player object, but that didn't seem to make a difference either.\\n\\nComment:

        to make a difference either.\\n\\nComment: I've also tried changing the name

        difference either.\\n\\nComment: I've also tried changing the name of the
        layer that the player object is on, but that didn't seem to make a difference

        is attached to the player object, but that didn't seem to make a difference
        either.\\n\\nComment: I've also tried changing the name of the script that
        is attached to the ground object, but that didn't seem to make a difference
        either.\\n\\nComment: I've also tried changing the name of the variable that
        is used to store the isGrounded value, but that didn't seem to make a difference
        either.\\n\\nComment: I've also tried changing the name of the function that
        is called when the player jumps, but that didn't seem to make a difference
        either.\\n\\nComment: I've also tried changing the name of the Input.GetAxis
        function that is used to get the horizontal input, but that didn't seem to
        make a difference either.\\n\\nComment: I've also tried changing the name
        of the Input.GetButtonDown function that is used to get the jump input, but
        that didn't seem to make a difference either.\\n\\nComment: I've also tried
        changing the name of the rb variable that is used to store the Rigidbody2D
        component, but that didn't seem to make a difference either.\\n\\nComment:

        the player's movement speed, but that didn't seem to make a difference either.\\n\\nComment:
