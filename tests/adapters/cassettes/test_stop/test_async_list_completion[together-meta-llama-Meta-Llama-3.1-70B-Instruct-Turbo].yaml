        cell\\nD) To regulate cell growth and division\\n\\nAnswer: C) To generate
        energy for the cell\\n\\nReasoning Skill: Identifying Pros And Cons\\n\\nIn
        this question, the correct answer is C) To generate energy for the cell. The
        mitochondria are often referred to as the \\\"powerhouses\\\" of the cell
        because they produce most of the energy that the cell needs to function. The
        other options are incorrect because the mitochondria are not primarily involved
        in protein synthesis (A), storing genetic information (B), or regulating cell
        growth and division (D).\\n\\nTo answer this question correctly, one needs
        to identify the primary function of the mitochondria, which requires an understanding
        of the cell's structure and function. This involves analyzing the pros and
        cons of each option and selecting the one that is most accurate. In this case,
        the correct answer is the one that highlights the mitochondria's role in energy
        production. \\n\\nNote: The question is designed to test the understanding
        of the mitochondria's function, which is a fundamental concept in cell biology.
        The reasoning skill required is Identifying Pros And Cons, as the student
        needs to evaluate the options and select the most appropriate one.\\nThe best
