        I\u2019m Dr. Lisa, and I\u2019m an addiction psychiatrist and therapist. Welcome
        to my channel, Addiction Insights.\\nToday, I want to talk about a very common
        phenomenon that people in recovery often report: the urge to relapse, or the
        experience of intense cravings for substances or other addictive behaviors.
        These urges can be overwhelming, but it\u2019s essential to understand that
        they are a normal part of recovery.\\nSo, let\u2019s break down what an urge
        is. An urge is a strong desire or craving to engage in a specific behavior,
        such as using a particular substance or acting out in a certain way. Urges
        can be intense, but they are typically short-lived. In other words, the urge
        itself doesn\u2019t last forever.\\nNow, let\u2019s talk about what happens
        when we experience an intense urge. When an urge hits, our brain gets a rush
        of chemicals, including dopamine, which is often referred to as the neurotransmitter
        of pleasure. This can make us feel like we \u201Chave\u201D to act on the
        urge, even if we know it\u2019s not a good idea.\\nBut here\u2019s the thing:
        urges are not the problem. It\u2019s the thinking and actions that we take
        when we experience an urge that can lead to relapse.\\nThink of urges as waves.
        They come and go, and they\u2019re not necessarily a reflection of our character
        or our willpower. We can learn to ride out these urges without acting on them.
        And, with practice, we can become more comfortable with uncertainty and discomfort.\\nSo,
        what can you do when you experience an intense urge to relapse? Here are a
        few strategies that might be helpful:\\nFirst, take a few deep breaths. This
        can help calm your body and mind, making it easier to think more clearly.\\nSecond,
        acknowledge the urge. Recognize that the urge is normal and that it won\u2019t
        last forever. Try to separate yourself from the urge, and remember that you
        are not your addiction.\\nThird, engage in a healthy distraction. This can
        be anything from going for a walk to watching a funny movie to practicing
        a relaxation technique like progressive muscle relaxation.\\nFourth, seek
        support. Reach out to a trusted friend or family member, or call a support
        hotline. Sometimes just talking through an urge with someone who understands
        can make all the difference.\\nAnd finally, practice self-compassion. Remember
        that you are human, and it\u2019s okay to experience difficult emotions and
        urges. Try to be kind and patient with yourself, and remind yourself that
        you have the skills and support you need to manage these urges.\\nIn conclusion,
        urges are a normal part of recovery, but they don\u2019t have to lead to relapse.
        With practice, patience, and self-compassion, you can learn to ride out these
        urges and maintain your recovery. Thanks for watching, and I\u2019ll see you
        in the next video.\\nIf you liked this video, be sure to like, comment, and
