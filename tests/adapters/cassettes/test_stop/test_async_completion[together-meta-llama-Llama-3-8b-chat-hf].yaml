        a simple text-based interface to interact with the user. It sends a message
        to the user, waits for a response, and then sends a follow-up message based
        on the user's response. The script uses a `send_message` function to send
        messages to the user, and a `receive_message` function to receive responses
        from the user. The `close_conversation` function is used to close the conversation
        and end the script.\\n\\nNote that this script is just a simple example, and
        you may want to add more features or complexity to your script depending on
        your specific use case. Additionally, you will need to implement the `send_message`
        and `receive_message` functions to actually send and receive messages with
        the user. These functions will depend on the specific platform or technology
        you are using to interact with the user.\",\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\",\n
