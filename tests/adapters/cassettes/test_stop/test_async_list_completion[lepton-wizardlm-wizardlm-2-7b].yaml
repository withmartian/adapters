        Q. Which of the following is true about the relationship between entropy and
        energy distribution in a system?\nA. Entropy increases as energy becomes more
        evenly distributed among the system''s states.\nB. Entropy decreases as energy
        becomes more evenly distributed among the system''s states.\nC. Entropy increases
        as energy becomes less evenly distributed among the system''s states.\nD.
        Entropy decreases as energy becomes less evenly distributed among the system''s
        states.\n\nThe answer is A. Entropy increases as energy becomes more evenly
        distributed among the system''s states. This is a fundamental principle of
        thermodynamics known as the second law of thermodynamics, which states that
