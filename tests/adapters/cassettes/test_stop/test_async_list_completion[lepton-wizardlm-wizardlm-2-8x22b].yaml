        I''m from the UK and I have a question about the H1B visa process for a job
        in the USA.\nI have recently been offered a job with a company in the US and
        they are willing to sponsor me for a H1B visa. I understand that there is
        a cap on the number of H1B visas issued each year, and that applications are
        submitted in April for the fiscal year starting in October.\n\nMy question
        is, if my employer submits my application in April 2023, when would I actually
        be able to start working in the US? Would it be as soon as October 2023, or
        is there typically a delay? Additionally, if I am selected in the lottery,
        how long do I have to activate the visa and enter the US?\n\nAny insights
        or experiences you could share would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\nUser
        4: If you are selected in the lottery, you can start working as early as October
        1st, 2023. However, you will need to wait for the actual visa approval before
        you can enter the US. The approval can take a few weeks to a few months after
        the lottery selection. You will","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1,"total_tokens":257,"completion_tokens":256}}'
