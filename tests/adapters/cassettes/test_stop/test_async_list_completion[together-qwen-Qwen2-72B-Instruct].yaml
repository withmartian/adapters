        I'm a 10th grader and I'm interested in participating in the USAMO. I've never
        taken the AMC 12 before, but I have taken the AMC 10 and gotten a 120.5. I'm
        not sure if I'm eligible to take the USAMO, but if I am, how do I go about
        doing it? I'm not sure if I'm too late or not, but I'd like to know for next
        year if I am. Thanks for your help.\\nYou are eligible to take the USAMO.
        \ You need to take the AMC 12 and score high enough to qualify for the AIME.
        \ Then you need to score high enough on the AIME to qualify for the USAMO.
        \ The qualifying score for the AIME is usually around 100, and the qualifying
        score for the USAMO is usually around 220 (AMC 12 + 10*AIME).  The AMC 12
        is in February, so you are not too late for this year.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou
        are eligible to take the USAMO if you are a citizen or legal resident of the
        US or Canada, and if you are in high school or below (or the equivalent homeschooling
        level).  You do not have to have taken any of the AMC tests before.  You do
        have to take the AMC 12 this year and score high enough to qualify for the
        AIME.  Then you have to take the AIME and score high enough to qualify for
        the USAMO.  The AMC 12 is in February, so you are not too late for this year.
        \ See the AMC web site for more details.\\nThanks for the help. I'm definitely
        going to try to take it this year. I'm just wondering, how hard is it to make
        it to MOP? I'm not sure if I'm good enough to make it, but I'm going to try.
        I'm just wondering what I have to do to get there.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's very
        hard to make it to MOP.  You have to score very high on the USAMO.  The number
        of students invited to MOP is around 30 for the \\\"Blue\\\" group, 12 for
        the \\\"Black\\\" group, and 30 for the \\\"Red\\\" group.  The Blue group
        is the top 30 non-seniors, the Black group is the top 12 overall, and the
        Red group is the top 30 9th graders.  So if you are a 9th grader, you have
        a slightly better chance of making it to MOP.  But it is still very hard.
        \ You have to be one of the top 30 9th graders in the country.  The USAMO
        is a very hard test.  Most students who take it do not solve any of the problems.
        \ So you have to be very good to make it to MOP.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI would say
        that it is extremely hard to make it to MOP.  I would say that it is harder
        than making USAMO.  I would say that it is harder than making AIME.  I would
        say that it is harder than making USAMO, AIME, and getting a perfect score
        on the AMC 12.  I would say that it is harder than getting a perfect score
        on the AMC 12.  I would say that it is harder than getting a perfect score
        on the AMC 10.  I would say that it is harder than getting a perfect score
        on the AMC 8.  I would say that it is harder than getting a perfect score
