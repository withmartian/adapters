        I am looking for a way to generate a list of tuples from a list of values.\n\nI
        have a list of values (in this case, tuples of two elements).\n\n```\nlist_values
        = [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1),
        (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)]\n```\n\nI want to
        create a list of tuples, where each tuple has two elements: the value from
        the first element in the original tuple, and the count of how many times that
        value appears.\n\nThe desired result is:\n\n```\nresult = [(1, 4), (2, 4),
        (3, 4), (4, 4)]\n```\n\nHow can I achieve this using Python?\n\nThis is what
        I have so far:\n\n```\n","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1,"total_tokens":257,"completion_tokens":256}}'
