        I'm a 10th grader and I'm interested in participating in the USAMO. I've never
        taken the AMC 12 before, but I have taken the AMC 10 and gotten a 120.5. I'm
        not sure if I'm eligible to take the USAMO, but if I am, how do I go about
        doing it? I'm not sure if I'm too late or not, but I'd like to know for next
        year if I am. Thanks for your help.\\nYou are eligible to take the USAMO.
        \ You need to take the AMC 12 and score high enough to qualify for the AIME.
        \ Then you need to score high enough on the AIME to qualify for the USAMO.
        \ The qualifying score for the AIME is usually around 100, and the qualifying
        score for the USAMO is usually around 220 (AMC 12 + 10*AIME).  The AMC 12
        is in February, so you are not too late for this year.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou
        are eligible to take the USAMO if you are a citizen or legal resident of the
        US or Canada, and if you are in high school or below (or the equivalent homeschooling
        level).  You do not have to have taken any of the AMC tests before.  You do
        have to take the AMC 12 this year and score high enough to qualify for the
        AIME.  Then you have to take the AIME and score high enough to qualify for
        the USAMO.  The AMC 12 is in February, so you are not too late for this year.
        \ See the AMC web site for more details.\\nThanks for the help. I'll try to
        take the AMC 12 this year. I'm not sure if my school offers it, but I'll try
        to find out. If they don't, is there any other way I can take it?\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf
        your school doesn't offer the AMC tests, you can try to convince them to do
        so.  The tests cost only $40 for a bundle of 10, so it's not very expensive.
        \ You can also take the test at another school or at a local college.  See
        the AMC web site for more details.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can also take it at a
        nearby university.  I took the AMC 12 at the University of Texas at Dallas
        last year.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI took the AMC 10 at a local university this year.

        \ Thank you.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can take the AMC 10 and the AMC 12 on the

        the AMC 12B, or the AMC 12A and the AMC 10B, but not both the AMC 10A and
        the AMC 12A, or both the AMC 10B and the AMC 12B.  If you take the AMC 10
        and the AMC 12 on different days, you can take the AIME at the location where
        you scored higher.  If you take the AMC 10 and the AMC 12 on the same day,
        you can take the AIME at the location where you registered for the AMC 10
        or the AMC 12.  If you took the AMC 10 at a university and the AMC 12 at your
        school, and you scored higher on the AMC 10, you can take the AIME at the
        university.  If you scored higher on the AMC 12, you can take the AIME at
        your school.  If you scored the same on the AMC 10 and the AMC 12, you can
        take the AIME at either location.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for the clarification.
        \ I think I will take the AMC 10A at the university and the AMC 12B at my
        school.  That way, I have two chances to qualify for the AIME, and I can take
        the AIME at the location where I scored higher.  I'm feeling pretty confident
        about my chances of qualifying for the AIME this year.  I've been practicing
        a lot, and I feel like I've improved a lot since last year.  I'm also feeling
