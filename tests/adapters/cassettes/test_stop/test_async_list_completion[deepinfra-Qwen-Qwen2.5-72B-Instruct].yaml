        am trying to increase range of Open CV live stream from an IP camera , how

        meters across the network I am working on\n\nIncreasing the range of an OpenCV
        live stream from an IP camera involves addressing both the network infrastructure
        and the camera settings. Here are some steps you can take to improve the range
        and reliability of the IP camera feed:\n\n### 1. **Improve Network Infrastructure**\n-
        **Upgrade Network Equipment**: Ensure that your router, switches, and other
        network equipment are of high quality and capable of handling the bandwidth
        required for video streaming.\n- **Use Wired Connections**: If possible, use
        Ethernet cables instead of Wi-Fi to reduce latency and improve stability.\n-
