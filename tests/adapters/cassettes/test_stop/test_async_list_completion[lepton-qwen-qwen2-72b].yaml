        I have a class in which I have to calculate the area of a rectangle. I have
        the constructor and the method but when I try to compile I get the error that
        it cannot find symbol.\n\n```\npublic class Rectangle {\n\n    private double
        length;\n    private double width;\n\n    public Rectangle(double l, double
        w) {\n        length = l;\n        width = w;\n    }\n\n    public double
        area() {\n        double area = length * width;\n        return area;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nI
        am trying to calculate the area of a rectangle with length 4.5 and width 7.2.
        Here is the code I am using to call the method:\n\n```\nRectangle rect = new
        Rectangle(4.5, 7.2);\ndouble rectArea = rect.area();\nSystem.out.println(\"The
        area of the rectangle is: \" + rectArea);\n\n```\n\nBut when I try to compile
        it I get the error that it cannot find symbol for the area method. What am
        I doing wrong?\n\nIt looks like you are encountering a \"cannot find symbol\"
        error because the `area` method might not be recognized in your code. This
        can happen due to several reasons such as incorrect class or method naming,
        incorrect import statements, or issues with the build path","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1,"total_tokens":257,"completion_tokens":256}}'
