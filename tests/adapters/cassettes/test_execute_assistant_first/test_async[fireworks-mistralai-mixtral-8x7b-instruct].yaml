        the importance of truth?\n\nAssistante: Of course, I''d be happy to help with
        that. Here''s a short poem about the importance of truth:\n\nIn realms where
        shadows often play,\nTruth is the light that shows the way.\nA beacon stern
        in a storm''s rage,\nA gentle guide on life''s stage.\n\nIt''s the bond that
        ties hearts and minds,\nThe harmony in every balance we find.\nIn truth, we
        find our strength and bane,\nYet, its wisdom, we must seek and sustain.\n\nThrough
        truth, we grow, we learn, we share,\nIn its embrace, we find life''s rarest
        fairness.\nIn moments dark or filled with glee,\nEmbrace truth and you''ll
        forever be free."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":64,"total_tokens":320,"completion_tokens":256}}'
