        a song by Wings. Here are some key points about the song:\n\n1. **Release
        and Chart Performance**:\n   - **\"Hi, Hi, Hi\"** was released as a double
        A-side single with \"C Moon\" in 1972. It peaked at number one in Spain, number
        five in the United Kingdom, and number 10 in the United States in January
        1973[2].\n\n2. **Song Details**:\n   - The song was written by Paul and Linda
        McCartney and performed by Wings. It was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in
        London and is classified as glam rock. The song''s length is 3:07 minutes[2].\n\n3.
        **Lyrics and Controversy**:\n   - The song''s lyrics were considered sexually
        suggestive and were banned by the BBC in the UK. Paul McCartney clarified
        that the lyrics were misinterpreted, particularly the line \"get you ready
        for my polygon,\" which was mistaken for \"get you ready for my body gun\"[2][3].\n\n4.
        **Inclusion in Compilations**:\n   - **\"Hi, Hi, Hi\"** has been included
        in several Paul McCartney compilation albums, such as \"Wingspan: Hits and
        History\" (2001), the deluxe edition of \"Pure McCartney\" (2016), and as
        a bonus track on the 1993 and 2018 reissues of \"Red Rose Speedway\"[2].\n\n5.
        **Live Performances**:\n   - The song became a staple of Wings'' live shows
        in the 1970s and was often introduced with the announcement that it was banned,
        which added to its appeal[2].\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer
