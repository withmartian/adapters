        "content": "The phrase \"Hi, Hi, Hi\" is most notably associated with a song
        by the band Wings, which was formed by Paul McCartney after his time with
        The Beatles.\n\n## Key Points About the Song:\n- \"Hi, Hi, Hi\" was written
        by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by Wings[2][4][5].\n- It was released
        as a double A-side single with \"C Moon\" on December 1, 1972, in the UK and
        a few days later in the US[2].\n- The song is classified under the glam rock
        genre and was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London[2].\n- It achieved
        significant chart success, peaking at number one in Spain, number five in
        the UK, and number 10 in the US[2].\n- The song was included in several of
        Paul McCartney''s compilation albums, including *Wingspan: Hits and History*,
        *Pure McCartney*, and reissues of *Red Rose Speedway*[2].\n\n## Controversy:\n-
        The song was banned by the BBC due to its sexually suggestive lyrics and a
        perceived drug reference in the title phrase. However, Paul McCartney clarified
        that the lyrics were misinterpreted, and the correct phrase is \"get you ready
        for my polygon\"[2].\n\nThe song remains a popular and energetic track in
        Wings'' discography, often featured in their live performances."}, "delta":
