        **Song by Wings**: \"Hi, Hi, Hi\" is a song written by Paul and Linda McCartney
        and performed by the band Wings. It was released as a double A-side single
        with \"C Moon\" in 1972. The song was banned by the BBC in the UK due to its
        sexually suggestive lyrics and was a staple of Wings'' live shows in the 1970s[2][3].\n\n2.
        **Hihi.com**: \"Hihi\" is also the name of an online shopping platform (hellohihi.com)
        that specializes in anime, figures, plushies, manga, kawaii items, and other
        related merchandise[1]. However, this is unrelated to the song by Wings.\n\nIf
        you have any specific questions about the song or the shopping platform, feel
        free to ask"}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
