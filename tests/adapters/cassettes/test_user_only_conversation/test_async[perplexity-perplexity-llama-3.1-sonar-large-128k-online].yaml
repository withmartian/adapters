        primarily used as an informal greeting, similar to \"hello\" or \"hi there.\"\n\n##
        Meaning and Usage\n- \"Hi\" is an informal word used to greet someone, especially
        in casual settings. It is equivalent to the Portuguese \"oi\" or the Spanish
        \"hola\" in informality[2][3][4].\n\n## Contexts\n- It can be used in various
        contexts, such as starting a conversation, breaking the ice, or expressing
        friendliness. For example, \"Hi, how are you?\" or \"Hi, nice to meet you\"[2].\n-
        \"Hi\" is versatile and can be adapted to different cultures and regions where
        English is spoken. For instance, \"Hi mate, how\u2019s everything?\" in Australia
        or \"Hi y\u2019all, what\u2019s up?\" in the Southern United States[2].\n\n##
        Origins\n- The word \"hi\" is a shortened form of \"hello,\" which itself
        derived from older greetings like \"hail\" or \"heil,\" originally used to
        wish health and well-being[2].\n\n## Formality\n- Unlike \"hello,\" which
        can be used in both formal and informal settings, \"hi\" is generally reserved
        for informal interactions among friends, family, or in casual situations[2][4].\n\nIn
        summary, \"hi\" is a common, informal greeting in English, used to initiate
        conversations and express a friendly or casual tone."}, "delta": {"role":
