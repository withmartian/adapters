        It looks like you''ve typed a quotation mark but nothing else. Is there something
        specific you would like me to help you with? I''m here to answer any questions
        you have to the best of my ability. Just let me know what''s on your mind!\n\nIn
        the meantime, here''s a fun fact about quotation marks: they are used to indicate
        direct speech or to show that a word or phrase is being used in a way that
        is not its usual or literal sense. For example, if you wanted to indicate
        that someone said the word \"hello,\" you would put it in quotation marks
        like this: \"hello.\" Or, if you wanted to use the word \"apple\" to refer
        to a company rather than the fruit, you might write \"I love my new iPhone
        - it''s made by Apple.\" In this case, the word \"apple\" is in quotation
        marks to show that it is being used in a metaphorical or non-literal sense.\n\nI
        hope this information is helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions.
