        "content": "Quotation marks, also known as speech marks, are punctuation marks
        used to indicate direct speech, quotations, and to set apart specific terms
        or titles. Here are the key points about quotation marks:\n\n### Definition
        and Usage\n- **Direct Speech**: Quotation marks are used to enclose the exact
        words of a speaker in direct speech. For example: \u201cI had a dream,\u201d
        said Martin Luther King[1][2][3].\n- **Titles and Names**: They are also used
        to indicate the titles of creative works, such as poems, songs, or short stories,
        and to highlight specific terms or phrases. For example: \"The Importance
        of Being Earnest\" or ''WFH'' (Work from Home)[1][2][4].\n\n### Single vs.
        Double Quotation Marks\n- **American English**: Double quotation marks are
        used for main quotes, and single quotation marks are used for quotes within
        quotes. For example: \u201cMy last boss used to always say, \u2018You sell
        more before lunch than the others sell in a week,\u2019 \u201d Amira mentioned
        in her job interview[2][4].\n- **British English**: Single quotation marks
        are used for main quotes, and double quotation marks are used for quotes within
        quotes. However, both styles are acceptable in British English[2][4].\n\n###
        Punctuation Rules\n- **Commas and Periods**: In American English, commas and
        periods are placed inside quotation marks. For example: \u201cTake off your
        dirty shoes before coming into the house,\u201d my father said[2].\n- **Question
        Marks**: Question marks are placed inside quotation marks if the person quoted
        was asking a question. For example: Smith asks, \u201cHow long can this situation
        continue?\u201d[4].\n\n### Quotes within Quotes\n- When a quote is nested
        within another quote, the opposite style of quotation marks is used. For example:\n  -
        In American English: \u201cHe said, \u2018I love the theater. I went to see
        \u201cSample Performance\u201d last week.\u2019\u201d\n  - In British English:
        He said, \u201cI love the theater. I went to see \u2018Sample Performance\u2019
        last week.\u201d[2][5].\n\n### Academic Writing\n- In academic writing, quotation
        marks are used to indicate direct quotes from sources. Signal phrases should
        be used to introduce the quoted material and integrate it into the text[4].\n\nUnderstanding
        these rules helps ensure that quotation marks are used correctly in various
        contexts."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
