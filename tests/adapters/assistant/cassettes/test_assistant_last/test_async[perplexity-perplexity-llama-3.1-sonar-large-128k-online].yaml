        "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Quotation marks are an essential
        part of English punctuation, serving several key functions. Here are the main
        uses and rules for quotation marks:\n\n## Types of Quotation Marks\n\n- **Double
        Quotation Marks**: These are commonly used in American English to indicate
        direct speech, quote someone''s exact words, or cite written or spoken material
        from another source. For example:\n  - \u201cI had a dream,\u201d said Martin
        Luther King[1][3][5].\n\n- **Single Quotation Marks**: In American English,
        single quotation marks are used for quotes within quotes. However, in British
        English, they are primarily used for direct speech, titles, and other quotations,
        with double quotation marks used for quotes within quotes.\n  - Example in
        American English: \u201cMy last boss used to always say, \u2018You sell more
        before lunch than the others sell in a week,\u2019 \u201d Amira mentioned
        in her job interview[3].\n  - Example in British English: \u2018The Importance
        of Being Earnest\u2019 is a play by Oscar Wilde[1][3].\n\n## Uses of Quotation
        Marks\n\n- **Direct Speech and Quotations**: Quotation marks are used to enclose
        direct speech or exact quotes from someone else.\n  - Example: \u201cTake
        off your dirty shoes before coming into the house,\u201d my father said[3].\n\n-
        **Titles of Works**: Quotation marks are used for the titles of short works
        such as poems, songs, and short stories, while italics are used for longer
        works like books, films, and stage plays.\n  - Example: The title of the song
        was \u201cGloria\u201d[1][3].\n\n- **Irony or Special Usage**: Quotation marks
        can indicate irony, doubt, or non-standard usage of a word.\n  - Example:
        The lunch lady plopped a glob of \"food\" onto my tray[2].\n\n- **Emphasis
        or Unusual Usage**: They can also be used to emphasize a word or phrase or
        to indicate that a word is being used in an unusual or non-standard way.\n  -
        Example: Dawkins''s concept of a meme could be described as an \"evolving
        idea\"[2].\n\n## Punctuation Rules\n\n- **American English**: Punctuation
        marks are typically placed inside the quotation marks.\n  - Example: \u201cTake
        off your dirty shoes before coming into the house,\u201d my father said[3].\n\n-
        **British English**: Punctuation marks are placed outside the quotation marks
        unless they are part of the original quoted material.\n  - Example: \"Carefree\",
        in general, means \"free from care or anxiety\"[2].\n\n## Other Considerations\n\n-
        **Nested Quotations**: In American English, single quotation marks are used
        for quotes within quotes, while in British English, double quotation marks
        are used for this purpose[1][3][5].\n\n- **Academic Writing**: In academic
        writing, quotation marks are used to quote sources, including published works
        and primary data such as interviews. A signal phrase should be used to introduce
        the quote and integrate it into the text[5].\n\nBy following these guidelines,
        you can ensure the correct use of quotation marks in your writing."}, "delta":
