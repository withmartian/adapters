        "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Quotation marks are punctuation
        marks used to indicate direct speech, quotations, and titles of works. Here
        are some key points about their usage:\n\n1. **Types of Quotation Marks**:\n   -
        **Single Quotation Marks**: Used to quote names, book titles, movie titles,
        and specific terms. For example, ''The Importance of Being Earnest'', ''Don'',
        and ''WFH''[1].\n   - **Double Quotation Marks**: Used to quote direct speech
        and written or spoken words by another person. For example, \"I had a dream\",
        said Martin Luther King[1].\n\n2. **Usage in Different English Styles**:\n   -
        **American English**: Double quotation marks are used for direct quotes, and
        single quotation marks are used for quotes within quotes[3][5].\n   - **British
        English**: Single quotation marks are used for direct quotes, and double quotation
        marks are used for quotes within quotes[3][4].\n\n3. **Punctuation Placement**:\n   -
        **American English**: Punctuation marks are placed inside the quotation marks
        unless they are part of the original quotation[3].\n   - **British English**:
        Punctuation marks are placed outside the quotation marks unless they are part
        of the original quotation[2][3].\n\n4. **Special Uses**:\n   - **Irony and
        Unusual Usage**: Quotation marks can be used to indicate irony, dubious words,
        or non-standard usage. For example, \"food\" in ''The lunch lady plopped a
        glob of \"food\" onto my tray''[2].\n   - **Titles and Specific Terms**: Quotation
        marks are used for titles of short works like poems and songs, while italics
        are used for longer works like books and films[3][4].\n\n5. **Academic Writing**:\n   -
        Quotation marks are essential in academic writing to indicate direct quotes
        from sources, including published works and primary data like interviews[4].\n\n###
