        "content": "To determine when to use single quotation marks versus double
        quotation marks, here are the key guidelines, particularly focusing on American
        English:\n\n## Double Quotation Marks\n- **Direct Quotes**: Use double quotation
        marks to indicate direct quotes from another source or to show dialogue[1][2][5].\n  -
        Example: \u201cThe teacher said, \u2018The exam will be difficult.\u2019\u201d\n-
        **Titles of Short Works**: Double quotation marks are used for the titles
        of short works such as poems, songs, and episodes of TV shows[1][4][5].\n  -
        Example: \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d by Robert Frost.\n- **Irony, Sarcasm,
        or Skepticism**: Use double quotation marks to set apart words that are used
        ironically, sarcastically, or skeptically, known as \u201cscare quotes\u201d[1][4][5].\n  -
        Example: \u201cMy daughter made me a \u2018coffee mug\u2019 in art class.\u201d\n-
        **Nicknames**: Double quotation marks can be used to differentiate nicknames
        from given names[1].\n  - Example: Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson.\n-
        **Words as Examples**: Use double quotation marks when discussing a word as
        a word, rather than its meaning[4].\n\n## Single Quotation Marks\n- **Quotes
        Within Quotes**: Single quotation marks are used when there is a quotation
        within a quotation[1][2][5].\n  - Example: \u201cThe professor said, \u2018As
        John Stuart Mill famously wrote, \u201cThe only purpose for which power can
        be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against
        his will, is to prevent harm to others.\u201d\u2018\u201d\n- **Headlines**:
        In headlines, single quotation marks may be used if a word or phrase is being
        quoted[3][5].\n  - Example: Fighting Irish \u2018come home\u2019 to Dublin.\n\n##
        Differences Between American and British English\n- In American English, double
        quotation marks are the standard, while in British English, single quotation
        marks are generally preferred. However, when a quotation appears within another
        quotation, the opposite type of quotation mark is used in both styles[1][2][3].\n\n##
        Additional Rules\n- **Placement with Other Punctuation**: In American English,
        periods and commas go inside the closing quotation marks, while dashes, semicolons,
        question marks, and exclamation points go inside if they apply to the quotation
        itself and outside if they apply to the whole sentence[5].\n- **Running Quotations**:
        For continuous quoted material spanning multiple paragraphs, use opening quotation
        marks at the start of each paragraph and closing quotation marks only at the
        very end of the quoted material[5]."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content":
