        "content": "To use single and double quotation marks correctly, follow these
        guidelines based on American English conventions:\n\n1. **Double Quotation
        Marks**:\n   - **Direct Quotes**: Use double quotation marks to indicate direct
        quotes. For example, \"I love reading,\" she said[1][2].\n   - **Titles of
        Short Works**: Double quotation marks are used for the titles of short works
        such as poems, songs, and magazine articles. For example, \"The Road Not Taken\"
        by Robert Frost[1][4].\n   - **Scare Quotes**: Double quotation marks can
        be used to indicate irony, sarcasm, or skepticism. For example, \"The ''equality''
        women achieved in 1920 was not true equality\"[4].\n   - **Words Used as Examples**:
        Double quotation marks can be used to refer to a word rather than its meaning.
        For example, \"The word ''they''re'' is often confused with ''their''\"[4].\n   -
        **Nicknames**: Double quotation marks are used to differentiate nicknames
        from given names. For example, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson[1].\n\n2. **Single
        Quotation Marks**:\n   - **Quoting Within a Quote**: Single quotation marks
        are used when there is a quotation within a quotation. For example, \"The
        professor said, ''As John Stuart Mill famously wrote, \"The only purpose for
        which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community,
        against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\"''\"[2][4].\n   - **Headlines**:
        Single quotation marks are used in headlines when quoting a word or phrase.
        For example, ''Fighting Irish ''come home'' to Dublin''[3].\n\n3. **Additional
        Tips**:\n   - **Consistency**: Be consistent in your use of quotation marks
        throughout your writing[3].\n   - **Avoid Overuse**: Use quotation marks sparingly
        and only when necessary to avoid cluttering your writing[2].\n   - **Punctuation
        Placement**: Periods and commas go inside closing quotation marks, while dashes,
        semicolons, question marks, and exclamation points go inside if they apply
        to the quotation and outside if they apply to the whole sentence[5].\n\n###
